So we had a great xmas. I am glad to be back but I was really happy to be able to spend <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03">christmas with my family</a>. my cat had a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20030.jpg">hole</a> in it. it was gross. but apparently it is getting filled in or has gotten filled in. it was really nasty. we all hung out and dressed up. my father wore his <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20009.jpg">bling</a> and I wore <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20007.jpg">my fur</a> - dylan was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20002.jpg">dressed normal</a>. I learned a bunch of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20037.jpg">magic</a>. it was awesome. <br/><br/>i really think that <a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~parasite/enterobius.html">pinworms</a> and <a href="http://www.ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/botfly.html">botflys</a> are gross. much grosser than holes in cats. <br/><br/>my thoughts go out to the knutson family.
