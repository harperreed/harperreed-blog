hehe. this weekend i took a flash trip to iowa to hang out with some old friend for my college homecoming. check out the pictures: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1151589/">flickr</a> or <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A10%3A16_homecoming">nata2</a>. the weekend was full of hijinx. we went to mt. vernon on friday. drank cheeep drinks. then bought beer to go (hah) and went to the dorms. then on saturday we watched the footbal game, went ot an art show and ate food. then we napped in the car and then went to cedar rapids for the worst dance i have ever been to. we ditched that and then went to iowa city and saw a bundle of people i hadn't seen in years. it ruled. 

my hair is getting out of control.
