On saturday - my mom, dad and hiromi all went to the hobby shop to look for hobbies for my father. he didn't find anything so I later went back and got him a <a href="http://www.ramseyelectronics.com/cgi-bin/commerce.exe?preadd=action&amp;key=PL130">130 in 1 electronic experimentation kit</a> and a <a href="http://www.modelflight.com.au/rc_model_cars/tamiya_rc_cars_rover_cooper.htm">fancy radio control car kit</a>. Hopefully he won't be bored.<br>
Then we all went ice skating.. well we didn't actually go ice skating - we went to an <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071968264-t610(1).jpg">figure skating show</a>. it was quite something. a friend of my family was in it - she was good. the figure skating was in the "<a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071968264-t610(1).jpg">natatorium</a>." heh. I don't quite know if I enjoy figure skating as of yet. I imagine I will figure that out soon enough. after the figure skating.. we went to a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071990746-t610(1).jpg">fancy party</a> dressed as future people.<br>
<br>
on sunday - we all hung out around the house and cooked. we made candy and peanut brittle and all sorts of goodies. I cut myself twice on the candy.. :( but that is ok ;)<br>
<br>
so last night I stayed up and made a opml reader - mostly cuz I wanted to be able to easily read all my favorite websites without a lot of work or even effort. so chekc it out <a href="http://dopeman.org/opmld/">here</a>. it is in the same vein as the <a href="http://dopeman.org/klip/">.klip maker</a> I made. hopefully it works for all. I did notice it didn't work for a couple. but whatever ;)<br>
<br>
soon I will be adding trackbacks and possibly comments to this blog. maybe. maybe not.<br>
<br>
eep!
