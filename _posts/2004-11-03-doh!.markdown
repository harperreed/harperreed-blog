omfg. so that sucked. <br/><br/>it was pretty harrowing to watch unfold. I mean. it appeared that we didn't even have a chance. and then I started drinking. which made the whole thing rediculous. I am now sleepy from drinking too much with too little food and too little consideration for reality. all I remember is laying on my bed and calling for my friends. then wooosh - morning. heh. and then we get bush for another four years. why is this how america rolls. this isn't rolling hard. this is rolling idiotically. I mean seriously. besides an isolationist, negative foreign policy and a hatred of foreigners what have we gained? oh yea. I forgot - war. nice. stupid war. stupid bush. haha. I am tired of all this. <Br><br/>so sleepy ;)
