i haven't really been blogging like I should. eh.. I get annoyed with it. so I don't do it. and then my friends and family contact me and yell. haha. so then I start again. heh. a "never ending" cycle of horror. heh. eh.. it isn't so bad. I don't really mind it. I just haven't had all the extra time in the world. only about half of all the extra time. 
<br/><br/>speaking of extra time. I have basically just watched movies for the past 4 days. I watched: 2010 space odyssy, return of the king, total recall, anchor man, the man with two brains, the toy, close encounters of the third kind and dusk til dawn. seriously I don't have any free time. haha. <br/><br/>i also spent quite a bit of time programming my microcontroller learning kit. hah. I picked up a basic stamp 2 <A href="http://www.parallax.com/detail.asp?product_id=28158">homework board</a> and a bunch of LEDs from radio shack. I made a couple neat things. basically just experimented with the board and programming in basic to control stuff. I forgot how to do electronics - but it is all coming back to me. I think I am going to get a <A href="http://www.parallax.com/javelin/index.asp">javelin</a> stamp next. ahh.. java. I am hopeing to be able to do some amount of threading - but I have no idea. I think I might be better off with <a href="http://www.reflections.co.nz/micro/GettingStarted/PIC-Getting-started.htm">pic microcontrollers</a> and programming in assembly. I will have to "experiment." luckily there is a multitude of <a href="http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/makendo.htm">things to make and do</a>.  now if I coudl only get funding. <br/><br/>lately I have also been working on making a couple sites that have been in the back of my mind for the last month. I have almost completed them . I wish them all to be done. DONE. I say. 
you shoudl check some of them out soon. hahah. not now though.<br/><br/>tv on the radio is a good band currently.<br/><br/>
i should get back to doing real work. haha. <br/><br/>i had so much more to say..  but I forgot. <br/><Br>ohoh. house of flying daggers is an incredible movie. very very good. <br/><br/>i am hungry.
