title: METAL... uhh.. i mean hanson
excerpt: So tonight I got home from work and rushed over to the house of blues to see hanson. my friend chris is friends with them so he hooked a bunch of us up with opera box seats.. and we hung out. it was really great. I was blown away by the talent and charisma that they held. it was intense. quite fun. we then hung out and just talked a bunch with them. they are nice. hopefully I got them to purchase...
