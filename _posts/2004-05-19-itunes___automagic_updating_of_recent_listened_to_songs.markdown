recently apple released a pretty good COM sdk for its <a href="http://itunes.com">itunes</a> program. my friend <a href="http://blog.andrewcarlson.org/">ajc</a> created some <a href="http://blog.andrewcarlson.org/archive/2004/05/18/239.aspx">sample code</a> that would post whatever song you are listening to currently to a webpage. I found this pretty cool. and quite handy. so I implement my own version and BAM. if you notice at the bottom of my page (below the del.ico.us links) I have a listing of the most recent 5 songs I have listened to. <br/><br/>the next step is to create a flash app to display the songs for myspace. that should rule. <br/><br/>then create an actual application rather than a console app. something that sits in the taskbar icons and chills out. maybe with some slick config - and some other tricks. it could be really cool. <br/>w00t. nice work andy. <br/><br/>really all this is going to do is show everyone that I only listen to like ten artists. haha. umm. yea. ;)<br/><br/>btw. this was my first foray into c# and it is pretty dope. I really like it and will probably spend some more time checking it out. heh. stupid programming. always filling my brain with thoughts.
