<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231589833/"><img height="180" alt="Hiromi and me!" src="http://static.flickr.com/81/231589833_9462c0d9eb_m.jpg" width="240" align="right"></a>So I leave on Sunday to go visit Hiromi in Tokyo. I am excited. It will be my 3rd time visiting her this year and I will be there for 13 days! whooo.&nbsp;I will be spending most of my time in Tokyo (I think), but&nbsp;we will be traveling to Yamanashi to celebrate new years with her family. It will be the first time I will meet most of them. I am excited and a bit nervous. I can't wait though. Maybe this time I will get to see MT. Fuji. hah. We will most likely be staying in Hiromi's grandparents house - which seems to be a rather <a href="http://www.tfujiiantiques.com/minka10.html">traditional Japanese farmhouse.</a> It will be really neat. </p> <p>This will be the first Christmas that I have been away from my family. I am kinda bummed about missing them, but very happy to be spending it with Hiromi. It is worth it. And I got my parents a webcam so we can skype it up on Christmas right after I arrive. Fun! Next year we will have to do both!</p> <p>I love flying. The whole frequent flier thing is such a scam, but it totally appeals to me. I love the idea of collecting things and then getting free things with what you have collected. I think this trip will finally flip me over the 100k miles mark on united. whooo. Maybe I will get a fancy upgrade again like last time. That would be nice. Flying the million miles to US from japan certainly is nicer when you are well fed and sleeping well.</p>
