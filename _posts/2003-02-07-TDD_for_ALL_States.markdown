I need to fix my car. when I say fix - I really mean register and insure it in chicago. I also need to get a chicago license. I have been skirting the law for awhile now and I can no longer do it(btw I am insured.. just not registered.. ugh). heh. last night matiss and I invited some cats to come over and watch the spooky michael jackson interview. boy that d00d is a weirdo. jesus. it is all very strange especially when you put his actions into perspective of a normal person. what if your neighbor was regularly sleeping and hanging out with a 44 year old man.. wtf. but overall I think the interview did a lot of good portraying jackson as a misunderstood ecentric. I ended up likeing him a lot more - as a person.. . he is just crazy. and apparently <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12612980&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50143">pissed</a>.. hehe. <br/>
<br/>So our country rules.. and the dumbasses over in the UK rule a bit more. they <a href="http://www.c8.com/c8/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1191&amp;highlight=">allegedly</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2735031.stm">plagerized</a> their "blistering" report on the state of IRAQ. what a set of tools. and bush in his infinite intelligence is continuing to be a wonderful president and is raising the risk color to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/07/threat.level/index.html">orange</a>.<br/> orange == high.
