so i sit in front of my TV and listen to music or watch old movies while i code. It is probably killer on my back and such - but it makes coding a lot less lonely and i get a lot done. But tonight it was really bad. My airport express was being a bitch and their was shit on tv - so i ended up watching VH1. MAN. i love crappy music. And amidst my awesome tv experience i kept taking pictures of the videos i liked with my phone.

there really needs to be a del.icio.us for life. i need to be able to tag that chris isaak video as hot and then watch it again and again.
