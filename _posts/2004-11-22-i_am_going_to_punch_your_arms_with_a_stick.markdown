this weekend was pretty fun. I hung out with the fam. yea know the drill. I apparently let my parents car out of the closet. stupid cars. hiding ALL THE TIME. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A11%3A22_fake_thanksgiving">here be</a> pictures. <Br><br/>
<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A11%3A14_Claudias_bbq">here are</a> other pictures of a different weekend a week ago. fun fun. but also insanity. <br/><br/>some interesting things are happening. it is fn. and not quite expected. but really nice. we shall see how they pan out. I want my <a href="http://www.freeipods.com/default.aspx?referer=6836892">free ipod</a>. I guess I will have to wait months and months for it to arrive. I will just have to start on my <a href="http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=12211878">free flatscreen</a>. these sites are so stupid. whatever.
