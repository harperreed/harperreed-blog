title: Server send off...
excerpt: So i sent off my server today. It was wierd just packing it in a box and sending it to someone whom i have never met or really talked to a lot. The place that is cohostin git seems kinda sketchy, but at the same time also seems really cool. They are a backbone provider for Ohio State, and the State of Ohio :)... so the bandwidth will be good - and i will be hooked pretty much directly on the back...

So i guess we shall see if it gets up ok. Did i ever mention that UPS rules?
