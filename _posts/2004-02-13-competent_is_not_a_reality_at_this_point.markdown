So I lost reality the other night. I was sittign at work - going live with this product (FINALLY) amd I noticed reality slinking out the door(<a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573111-picture(4).jpg">1</a>, <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573183-picture%281%29.jpg">2</a>, <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573365-picture%282%29.jpg">3</a>). I was pretty sure at that point that my life was going to get weird, so as any good boy would do - I just gave in and drank a lot more mt. dew. <br/>so what happened was this. we (WB) went live with this product on wednesday night. I was part of the night team  - so I had a bunch of <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076562062-picture(2).jpg">pop, 6 fruit rollups and a bunch of peanuts</a> in about 3 hours. I then wanted to die. I stayed up <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076562803-picture(2).jpg">delerious and wronged</a> until 9am with very very little sleep. I was able to have some fun though... and I did end up <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076565230-picture(2).jpg">watching some movies</a>. once I left work I was able to go to wicker park - where I about died of horrible poisoning from the bastardized version of breakfast mcdonalds sells - and sleep. once asleep, I really didn't notice anything happening until I woke up. morgan then beat me up and punched me in the throat. we hung out. then I attempted to go home and crash hard. however, my inner child was rebelling and made me goto a shoe store to <a href="http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1076686597-t610%281%29.jpg">buy future</a> <a href="http://www.citysoles.com/cs/products/03126f.html">shoes</a>. I made out like a bandit - a poor poor bandit. I then proceded to go home and sleep for not long enough. I hung out with matt and hiromi and then watched a bunch of dumb TV. it is nice it currently works. but it will soon stop I know it. I then went to morgans house to help her with her <a href="http://www.lathallan.com/timeline/Fullsize/0945am.jpg">secret project</a>.

<a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076646915-t610(1).jpg">valentines day</a> is in the marrow. I didn't get my brother a bday present. I am a slacker. I should however. maybe I will get him a <a href=""></a>. maye not ;). morgan and I our going to go to see <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/artist/807285?tm_link=tm_home_g10">Monster Jam Monster Truck Racing</a> tommarrow night. I am thrilled. apparently a bunch of others are going as well. it will be an experience. for occasions like this, I am glad I have a mullet/rattail. I am able to blend in. heh. morgan however may have some issues - as she does have a mohawk. I will have to be extra hick I guess to make up for the lack of hick she possesses. possesses has a bundle of ss. haha. ss. esses?<br/><br/>tonight I am going to sleep a bunch. and then goto <a href="http://redrocketgallery.com/">lenore and jason's gallery</a>. I like gallery openings - especially when I am not interested in the art. it turns into such a social event. I love socials. then apparently there is a party. <br/><br/>i have strangely and unfortunantly run out of disposable income for the month.<br/><br/>i get to act the future man for sure.<br/><br/>my new shoes squeek and it cracks me up.<br/><br/>i have not yet recovered from my night up.
