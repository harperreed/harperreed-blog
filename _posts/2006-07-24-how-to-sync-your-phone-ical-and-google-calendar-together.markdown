I use a lot of operating systems in my daily computing exercise, each one does its own thing. I use windows for development - which really means that i just use windows for putty and firefox. I use linux to host and write code. and i use OSX for personal information management. Today i am going to tell yall how i use the i-suite and <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> to have my calendars accessible all the time.

First off, I need to exercise some disclosure. I am not a OSX user. I don't know all the tricks and i totally don't know how to use OSX to its best. However, i will totally own a system if i can figure out a reason to (i say own in the gamer sorta way..). The reason i got a OSX box is to sync with my symbian phone. I loved the ability to back up my addressbook at a moments notice and to transfer my contacts from one phone to another. It was awesome. and as a side effect - i had ical sync as well. So that is where this starts.

So we start with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/">iCal</a>. iCal is a sweet simple calendaring application. I have a couple calendars set up that i use. One is home, another is travel and the other is work.  These three calendars i then publish to <a href="http://www.icalx.com">icalx.com</a>. I use icax because it is the easiest and the because its free. I have ical automatically publish changes at all time. I do publicly share my calendars - i figure that i am practiceing the "security through obscurity" model with my calendars - hopefully nobody will look. I share my calendars so that i can import the shared icalx url for each calendar into <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> and view all my events per individual calendar.

<a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> is an awesome. I really dig it. Being able to easily view my ical events in <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> has made <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> a nice client for my ical stuff - but i want it to go the otherway too. Luckily google has made it easy to do this with their private urls that are available per calendar. So i just import the calendar url into ical and boom - it shows up in my calendar. It is really that easy.

Right now we have <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> events in ical and ical events in <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> - however both pathways are read only. This is annoying and i can't really figure out how to fix that. But i don't think it really matters. Because i don't use <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> or ical as my only input or output - and i mostly use my phone. Which is where this entire system really shines.

Using isync - i can sync all of the events from <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> and ical onto my phone. w00t. so if i enter an event into <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>, i can see it on my phone after a sync. that rules. The only thing that is annoying is that if you attempt to edit an event on the phone that orginates from <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> - you will get an error about modifying a read only event. that sucks. so their are some bugs. but..  it works really well for me.  and with all the new <a href="http://www.s60.com">symbian phones</a> really trying hard to be PIMs it is quite awesome.
