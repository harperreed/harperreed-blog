<!-- END AREA NAME -->So my friend <a href="http://www.in5anity.org">jon</a> and his "team" of friends went to washington to present their biodiesel project for the EPAs <a href="http://es.epa.gov/ncer/p3/">P3: People, Prosperity and the Planet Student Design Competition for  Sustainability</a> grant. His project was a called <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/7730/report/0">Closing the Biodiesel Loop: Self Sustaining Community Based Biodiesel Production</a>, it was about creating a biodiesel production facility and attempting to make it self sustaining. It was awesome. I have posted some pictures of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/tags/biodiesel/">biodiesel installation</a> on flickr.
So anyway. Jon's team won the <a href="http://es.epa.gov/ncer/p3/project_websites/2006/2006awardwinners.html">grant contest</a> and got some <a href="http://tinyurl.com/o8m7t">pictures up on getty</a>. <a href="http://editorial.gettyimages.com/source/search/details_pop.aspx?iid=57576310&cdi=0">This is jon holding some biodiesel.</a> Awesome.

Anyway. I am really proud of him and happy that he and his team were so successful.
