apparently I need to practice before starting going out again. after a two week sabatical I went out again this weekend. it was fun - but I totally drank too much. so today I feel a little bit under the weather. stupid weather. my friend mike is in town and we have been hanging out. on friday night we went to eat at reza's and then an art opening andthen a party. it was fun. then on saturday we went to get sushi, then a party, then a bar and then to the BRMC. it was a bunch of craziness and honestly was a bit out of control. heh. so then we came home and now it is today. I am sleepy.
