I like buildings. When I was a child, my father subscribed to Architectural Digest. I used to read and look at the pictures of incredible architectural feats. I always imagined living in a place that had buildings that were nice. I finally found a building that is very nice. It is the <a href="http://www.dims.net/bm/building2.jpg">R.R. donnelley building</a>. Is a quite modern and has a neat lighting scheme. Inside it has incredible art and uses a lot of pretty black and white marble(i think).
