So I guess <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/14/opinion/14SAFI.html?ex=1037854800&amp;en=3778829e1bec3dc2&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE">reality</a> is <a href="http://wwwi.reuters.com/images/2002-11-14T002158Z_01_GALAXY-DC-MDF148570_RTRIDSP_2_ENTERTAINMENT-PEOPLE-JACKSON-DC.jpg">stranger</a> than <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/76916.html">fiction</a>.<br/><br/>In other news, I got the new lord of the rings dvd today. It was great. seriously. really really good. The extended stuff is so nice to watch. It makes me want to get that new TV so bad. I think I will order it tonight maybe. Maybe tomarrow. I think I have enough - all from 3gscreensaver. yeehaa
