i don't know what that means. does anyone remember the realgerbil page that mocked the <a href="http://www.realdoll.com">realdoll</a> page? remember the picture of the gerbil being violated.. heh. I wish I had saved that. what genius.. anyway.. at the <a href="">Middle East Web Log</a> there is a nifty article about how saddam is <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/log/archives/00000031.htm">hiding both the smoke and the guns</a>. I thought that bushes statement that "since we didn't find anything - that means they are hiding the weapons" - ruled. What logic. What if you went to the doctor and they were like.. "i can't find a disease - so we will put you in the hospital to cure the really nasty hidden ones.. " whatever. U.S. foriegn policy rules. ANd apparently the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030124-14721132.htm">domestic policy</a> also rules.. the <b>former</b> U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter was charged awhile back with luring a 16yr old girl to a resturant - where this gets interesting is that ritter is charging that this arrest was engineered by bush and bush's followers as a diversion to ritter's proposed alternative to a violent altercation in IRAQ. This is very interesting. wtf. <a href="http://www.bushwantswar.com">BUSH WANTS WAR</a>. 





<br/><br/>So <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com">rolling stone</a> ran <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newsarticle.asp?nid=17380">this article</a> about how some men are trying to acquire HIV. this acquisition is apparently a sexual fetish. However - rolling stone's claim that 25% of all "new" HIV victims have sought the virus on purpose is being challenged by <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030124-89194739.htm">quite</a> a <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/sullivan/2003/01/24/rolling/index.html">few</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=477516">A juggler gone bad</a>. Soon this will be <a href="http://www.therats.org">matiss</a>.. ;) speaking of matiss.. be sure and check out all the links on the left - especially my friends section. a lot of good weblogs... also if anyone wants to have a link up - email me..  <br/><br/>here is an incredible article about <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/rick_reilly/news/2003/01/23/life_of_reilly/">women's sports</a> and how the only way to get noticed in our society as a women athlete is to "Strip down to your panties and bra and wrestle over beer." sports rule.
