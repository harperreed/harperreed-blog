A week and a half ago <a href="http://www.christophersaathoff.com/">chris saathoff</a> was killed by a drunk driver. It is pretty sad (of course) - but watching his <a href="http://www.garbagetruck4000.com/">blog stop</A> and his friends <a href="http://www.liquidprint.com/chris.cfm">react</a>. the news story is <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0402160091feb16,1,5595556.story?coll=chi-newslocal-hed">rather sad</a> as well. <br/><br/>sometimes it is strange living in the city. with all the crap that goes on.. the gangs, the violence that is around us but "not" affecting us. wtf. it is dumb.
