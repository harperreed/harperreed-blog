there is a thunderstorm outside.  its november. wtf. 

i am sick. i haven't gone out in awhile. i have slept a LOT. a whole LOT. and cleaned. and got really fast cable internet. DSL is lame. i am sad - cuz i really liked speakeasy. but they were too expensive and cable was so easy and damned damned fast. i peak at like 7000kbps. that shit is nuts. NUTS. 

we are about to start watching ong bak. i am excited. 

i hope to go visit ladawn soon. tickets are not that expensive. i miss her. 

SLEEP!
