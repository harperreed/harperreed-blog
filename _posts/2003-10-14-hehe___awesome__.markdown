The other day a friend lent me one of the <a href="http://www.ckystore.com/">CKY videos</a>. I watched it.. and laughed.. and whatever.. so I thought today that I should do a little searching about cky and all related info. so I came accross <a href="http://www.bamargera.com/home.html">bam's</a> page. I was browsing it.. and came accross the <a href="http://www.bamargera.com/interview.html">interview page</a>. it is funny.. but the real interesting part is his fashion tip: rock tight black gear but spray paint it mist of white so it looks dirty. this is interesting.. cuz on one of my sites a couple years ago.. me and a friend decided to mock the <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/RockStarScenester">scenester lifestyle</a> and create a list of things to do to become a rock and roll scenester. we actually made them up.. so chekc out number 14: Buy tight black clothes but spray paint it a mist of white so it looks dirty. hehe. very similar. weird eh. so I did a google search to find whether I inadvertantly stole that phrase (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=a+mist+of+white+so+it+looks+dirty">here</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22a+mist+of+white+so+it+looks+dirty%22">here</a>). the phrase only appears in bam's interviews and my website. wtf. this is so confusing. how did this happen? I will never know. dylan left yesterday.. we had a good time. this week I am staying in. attempting to recoup my losses. I still want to convert cripple smash to php. it would rule.
