the past couple days have been real chill. I have <a href="http://dopeman.org/itunes">listened</a> to <a href="http://www.front242.com/splash.htm">front 242</a> exclusively. it is nice. I am a fan of head hunter. of course. <br/><br/>i remembered again how to use multiple irc servers with scrollz:<blockquote><small>/window new hide<br/>[esc 2]<br/>/window server irc.whatever.org<br/>/join #irule</small></blockquote>

this is helpful. <br/><br/>i have been workign a lot in c# recently. I really enjoy coding again. for the longest time I was doing a lot of administrative stuff. BORING. haha. but c# relaly gets me going. I love spending time browsing the com objects and seeign what they all do. haha. I am lame. <br/><br/>last night morgan and I went shopping for some formalish wear for the wedding this weekend. tonight hiromi and iw ill go and get a tie. I am scared of ties. they seem dumb.
