so when I was little. skinny puppy was my favorite band. now they are apparently back and touring. I discovered this when I woke up on sunday and had a shiny metal urge to chekc the readers early warning list. much to my amaze - skinny puppy was playing at the vic. so I immediately attempted to secure tickets. no luck. all sold out. in fact I think they were SOLD OUT. like in caps. pixies style. I was really sad. this is the only  band that I haven't seen from my childhood. first it was janes addiction - saw them in 2001(good stuff - sorry pam <b>;)</b>). then pixies - hopefully <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1082691247-Nokia6600(469).jpg">seeing them soon</a>. and now skinny puppy is coming. but it was sold out. so I immediately found matiss and we figured out how much we would pay to see our favorite of favorites. I <a href="http://chicago.craigslist.org/tix/29718513.html">searched</a> and found some dude who was offering them for 100. I was like.. hell no... so I looked at a ticket broker and finally <a href="http://www.goldcoasttickets.com/LiveTicketDetail.asp?EventID=286309">found some</a>. totally more than I would like to spend. but whatever. I NEED to see them. hahah. I am really excited. whee.
