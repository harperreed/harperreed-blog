I am currently at home. Hanging out. Having a great time. It is sometime sooo nice to be home. I forget that about traveling.

Anyway. I have posted all the pictures from this weekend. We have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594129393809/">Jon's Graduation</a>, some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594129747663/">night juggling pictures</a> and then pictures of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/tags/biodiesel/">Jon's biodiesel setup</a>.

The trip was nice.

Next weekend i am going to colorado. W00t.

Then i will be visiting fantasy land when i get my delivery of 14 Scifi and Fantasy books. whee.

I have posted a video of some bluegrass i took at Jon's Graduation party. Pretty awesome.
