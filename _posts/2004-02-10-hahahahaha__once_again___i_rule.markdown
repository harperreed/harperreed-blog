so a week or so ago I went to this party for the <a href="http://www.chicagothong.org/">chicago thong organization</a>, it was really funny and strange - but my friend chris and I participated in the activities and wore thongs and capes(which was the costume of choice). well later that night we were at a club and one of our friends snapped this really great <a href="http://ambrel.net/android/images/IMG_1453.jpg">shot of my ass</a>. when I got to work on monday and saw it - I thought immediately how fun(and funny) it would be to send it to my parents in a really nice frame. so I did. it was killing me however - cuz I had to wait quietly in the corner and let them receive it without me blowing the surprise. so today they receieved it. ;) and here is my fathers response (via aim of course):
<blockquote><small><b>PTSteveReed (3:11:02 PM)</b>: must have a lot of cheek to sen a picture like that!<br>
<b>linuXKilla (3:11:07 PM)</b>: hahaha<br>
<b>....</b><br>
<b>PTSteveReed (3:12:10 PM)</b>: I thought maybe you were showing us your new phone holder<br>
<b>....</b><br>
<b>PTSteveReed (3:14:08 PM)</b>: mom was terribly offended and hasn't slept at all since we got it<br>
<b>....</b><br>
<b>linuXKilla (3:14:37 PM)</b>: that is really funny<br>
<b>PTSteveReed (3:15:26 PM)</b>: I thought maybe you were advertising for a bakery with nice buns like that<br>
<b>linuXKilla (3:15:30 PM)</b>: hahaha.<br>
<b>PTSteveReed (3:15:36 PM)</b>: was there a full moon that night<br>
<b>PTSteveReed (3:15:48 PM)</b>: or were you just butting in<br>
<b>PTSteveReed (3:16:00 PM)</b>: let's get to the bottom of this<br></small></blockquote>

hopefully I will receive my <a href="http://danger.com/">sidekick today</a>. I am hopeing to <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/sidekick">hacking it</a> with the goal being to write some really nifty apps for it. mostly network security tools and blogging utils. I really like the idea of using it only for AIM. hah. I will continue to become a huge nerd. <a href="http://stuffthatisawesome.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/gatesmug.jpg">HUGE NERD</a>. speaking of random linking, check out my friend <a href="http://virtualdarts.typepad.com/">boone's new blog</a>. he has really taking to blogging with great style and <a href="http://www.studio7imaging.com/images/ultra_fractals/pizazz.jpg">pizazz</a> (that was a tribute link <b>;)</b>). I think I would like to write a small piece of code into my blog that will link to specific words I define with random images from googles image search. I think that would be entertaining.
