so I came to work. it was nice to go outside. I guess moving is good. although it was tough leaving the comfort (and depression) of my room - it is worth it to be out of the realm of my wallowing. <br/><br/>i listened to the butthole surfers on the way to work. hairway to steven. such a great album. hah. and then the cars. how did the cars do that. I really don't know. sooo good. ok. so I have a bunch of meetings that are really gunna make me mad in about 15 minutes. so I gotta chill out. I bought breakfast today. hmm. <Br><br/>in my last post I had lost hope. hope is back a bit. I like hope. we are good friends. I think that is why I get hurt sometimes. heh. stupid hope.
