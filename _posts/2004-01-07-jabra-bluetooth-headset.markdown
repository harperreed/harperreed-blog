so the other day I decided to pick up a <a href="http://jabra.com/products/FreeSpeak_Photo1.html">Jabra Freespeak</a> bluetooth headset for my t610. When wearing it I feel as though I am in the future. I thought about getting the <a href="http://www.nextlink.to/bluespoon/index.htm">digital bluespoon</a> but i felt bad paying more for the headset than i did for the phone. so i guess that will have to wait for when i get my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,4879,33210,00.html">6600</a>.

<a href="http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=143273">here is an awesome review of the bluespoon</a>
<a href="http://www.howardchui.com/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;sop=viewarticle&amp;artid=142&amp;page=3">here is a poor review of the jabra</a>

One of the factors i used in making my decision was reading <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005523.html">Russell Beatties's</a> write up and it seemed like he was very happy with it. so i thought.. maybe it isn't that bad.. and it is cheap. 

Now if I could get it to pair appropriately with my desktop - I could maybe use it as a VOIP headset.. and call my friends all over the world!
