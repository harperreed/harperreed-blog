that the saddest song in the world is Samuel Barber's <a href="http://www.artsworld.com/music-dance/works/a-c/adagio-for-strings-samuel-barber.html">Adagio for strings</a>. It is used in '<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0211915">Amelie</a>', '<a href="">platoon</a>', '<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0080678">elephant man</a>' and '<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104756">Lorenzo's Oil</a>.' So sad it is. apparently it was also used as funeral music (Princess Grace, JFK, and Franklin D Roosevelt). William Orbit did a good arrangement of it for his "Adagio for Strings" album. <br/><br/>So last night I went to felix's bday party at vision. I hate vision. seriously. it is sooo bad. but it was cool to see <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/2157955332.jpg">felix spin</a>. he really has a lot going on. bouncing and such. it was dope. I wonder if my silly little phone camera worked.. I will see soon. <br/><br/>war is a bummer eh.
