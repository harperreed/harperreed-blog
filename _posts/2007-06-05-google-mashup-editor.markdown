Today I got access to the <a href="http://code.google.com/gme/">Google Mashup Editor</a>. it is really nifty. I like it. The samples are amazing. I can't wait to sit down and play with it comprehensively. its really neat that the data is accessible with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/overview.html">gdata api</a>.

I think that combining this and <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">yahoo pipes</a> could lead to interesting results. Making a language translating feed reader, or a yahoo local/Google base mashup. Combining the magic of feeds with the webapp magic of Google mashup editor. Magic!

I need more time!
