HOW MY LIFE RULES. haha. I was like. wtf. then it was very funny. I don't really know how to react to that. other than laugh. I sent it to all my friends. haha. morgan was like "TELL HIM I MOVED OR DIED." hehe. rule.<br>
<br>
hiromi works now. as does matt and matiss. so once again I have from 6 until around 10 to hang out with myself. which is awesome. I get SOOOO bored. heh. so I usually sleep. now I remember how I started taking naps. I guess I need to gather some friends - even though I apparently have some - I can't seem to find any from 6-9.<br>
<br>
ok I guess I should goto bed. work is sucking lately. it was awesome. then suckage. stupid people who are not in aggrement with me. haha. well whatever. I will fight the "good" battle and probably lose. but its cool.<br>
<br>
i will post a surprise later tomorrow night. it will rule. you will smile.
