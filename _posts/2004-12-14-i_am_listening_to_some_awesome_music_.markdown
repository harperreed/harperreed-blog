last night all I did was play video games. I played <a href="http://www.chroniclogic.com/gish/">gish</a> for about an hour - it is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the motif quite a bit. I do wish it really looked like the still graphics look. I mean I is close - but it coudl be really awesome. it reminds me of the graphics from my favorite tv show ever: <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/InvaderZIM/">invader</a> <a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/zim/">zim</a>. and then I played <a href="http://www.chroniclogic.com/index.htm?bridgeit.htm">Bridge It</a> for about 45 minutes. so much fun. I love physics. haha. basically it allows you the constructor to build bridges of your wildest dreams. and then drive things across them. I made some crazy bridges - I tell you what. after that little stint as a god I joined my roommates for a quick two games of <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/570/570749p1.html">mario party six</a>. it ruled.<br>

i love css. and metal. I love metal more than I love css.<br>

this morning sucked. I basically ran around frnatically looking for my winter earrings. I have a pair of amber earrings that my friend mary got me - they are really cool and fit perfectly. however, I apparently lost them and all I can find are these other amber earrings that don't fit. it sucked. both because I really like having them (memories and all that jazz) and because they don't get cold like the blistering metal that is currently inhabiting the nation that is my ear lobes.<br>

now I am off to do work and read comics. and by comics I mean connect to a sql server db and write jsp code.
