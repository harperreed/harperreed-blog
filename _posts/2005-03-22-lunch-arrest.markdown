as mike an i were coming back from lunch, mike noticed that a bundle of people were looking down from windows in our work comlex. so we looked to where they were looking and saw these two guys who had trapped another guy in the middle of a rotating door. it was nuts. this dude aparently knocked some lady down and grabbed her purse/wallet. then took off running.  then these guys tracked him down and pinned him in the door waiting for the police to come. the guy looked incredibly desparate. i can't imagine how low you woudl have to be to steal a wallet - and then how you must feel to be trapped in front of a thousand people in a rotating door. sucks for him ;)

heh
insane.
