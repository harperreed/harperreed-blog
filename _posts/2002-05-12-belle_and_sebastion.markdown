Tonight my friend and myself went and saw belle and sebastion at the congress. It was incredible. They really rocked the house something fierce. They played a lot of great songs. and they ended with a rendition of Thin Lizzies "The Boys Are Back In Town."  The concert was so fun. Insanity. I didn't want it to end eva. heh. <br/><br/> I just found out that my site, audreyhacking.com was one of around 16 honorary mentions out of around 460. I didn't know. I mean I didn't win the big prize. but still, 16 out of 460 is pretty good. Yep I rule. haha. I wish that is what that meant. Hmm. I wonder what this will mean for my illustrious future?<br/><br/>
I am however one of the biggest nerds and I have such a crush.. but whatever. its fun and quite enjoyable.
