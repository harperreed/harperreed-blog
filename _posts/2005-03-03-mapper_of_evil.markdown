<p>so I have been thinking about going to des moines to see my friend <a href="http://derek.broox.com/" target="_self">derek</a> and I was talkign to him and he was all surprised that I woudl be coming out:</p><blockquote>(11:42:00) <strong>Derek Brooks:</strong> just to hang out?<br />(11:42:02) <strong>Work Aim:</strong> yea<br />(11:42:06) <strong>Derek Brooks:</strong> cool<br />(11:42:27) <strong>Derek Brooks:</strong> are you getting tired of fun<br />(11:43:41) <strong>Work Aim:</strong> hahaha<br /></blockquote><p>see what I have to deal with. last night I played with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_self">subversion</a>. it is pretty dope. it will really induce the collaborative work I have been doing lately. hopefully shit will get done. </p><p>check out my revisions to <a href="http://www.watership.org/" target="_self">watership.org</a>. it is a little bit more stalkerific than I originally wanted. but it is still fun. </p><p>i am really tired. I have been attempting to finish <a href="http://www.propertytechnica.com/" target="_self">my dad's site</a>, and finish my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/series/-/396/paperback/102-0184019-0095363" target="_self">fantasy novel series</a> (NERD!!) - both of which mean I DO not get any sleep. I really need to get sleep. I hope I will be able to sleep this weekend. but probably not. </p><p>check out the <a href="http://mapper.ofdoom.com/index.pike" target="_self">mapper of doom</a>.</p><p>anyway. </p>
