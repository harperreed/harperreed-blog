<p>So my cable went out today. Lame. After giving up on debugging it - I started playing with the FireFox error pages. I just wanted to look at the HTML. So once I selected all and view the source of the page. I noticed this funny little piece of HTML:</p> <blockquote> <p>&lt;xul:button xmlns:xul="<em>http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</em>" id="errorTryAgain" label="Try Again" oncommand="retryThis();"/&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></blockquote> <p>So. Apparently <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul">there is only XUL</a>. who is probably the keymaster and the gatekeeper. Or whatever. I am apparently the not the first person to notice this - since the naming is apparently a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">Ghostbusters reference itself</a> - and that their is a <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/wusteman/lht/wusteman-opax.doc">paper written about it</a>. Its awesome when companies or organizations that have their products on everyone's computers can have a sense of humor. I wonder if this would occur if it wasn't opensource. I imagine it would occur - but would be hidden from the public face. </p> <p>Awesome.</p>
