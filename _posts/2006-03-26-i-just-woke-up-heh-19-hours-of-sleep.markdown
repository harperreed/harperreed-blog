hahaha. i didn't mean to. i had set my alarms for 8pm last night. but apparently i didn't hear it or anything else until about 2 today. hah. whoops.

Well.. i was going to write up my experience in japan. I still think i will. However not right now. I also need to annotate all my pictures and such as well.  If you want to know about my trip right now!!! then check out <a href="http://hirominakazawa.com/2006/03/26/the-party-is-over/">hiromi's nice post about it</a>. Also feel free to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594085151914/">check out my pictures</a>. The whole trip was a brilliant time. funfun. I wish i was there now.

Well. i need to finish up my taxes. I think tomorrow is my goal for them being done. i am always such a slacker in regards to finishing them. i hate them. stupid taxes.

I also need to do laundry, and clean my room. hmm.. lets see how it goes.
