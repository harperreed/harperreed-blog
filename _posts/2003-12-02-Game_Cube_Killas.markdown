<a href="http://www.clubsonyericsson.com/en/products_t610.shtml">here</a> is my new cell phone specs. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fmms2blog">here</a> is the start to the mms photolog program. it is a bit complicated. stupid blogs ;) I will be putting all the pictures I take <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog">here</a>. I love cell phones.. they are my friends and companions forever. someday I will have fancy cell phone/wifi robot friends who will be rightful property owners.

on saturday my parents left. I was sad. but I get to go and see them soon. which will be nice. I will be in colorado for a week - then I will be back in chicago for a week. then back in colorado. I think.... anyway.. on saturday my friends and I were bored... so I went and bought a <a href="http://www.nintendogamecube.com/">gamecube</a> and a couple of <a href="http://www.mariokart.com/launch/index.html">fun</a> <a href="http://www.marioparty.com/">party</a> games. The best part about it all is the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gcnlarge?gallery=accessory&amp;currentNo=5">wireless controllers</a> - seriously.. so awesome. next is the broadband <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gcnlarge?gallery=accessory&amp;currentNo=7">connector</a>.. then with the help of phantasy star.. freedom.. and a homebrew dev system ;)<bR><br/>now off to the apple store with hiromi.. wheee<br/><br/>oh right I gotta do stuff later ;) I love later
