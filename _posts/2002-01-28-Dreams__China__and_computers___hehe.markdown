I don't know hardware that well so it was hard. <br/>The other dream I had was that the U.S. attacked china in order to start a war. It prompted china to engage in a nuclear strike - thus ending all civilization. that dream wasn't as fun. <br/>this weekend was crazy. I am not sure if it was a good time. I don't know what to think about anything.. arrggghh.. whatever.. hehe
