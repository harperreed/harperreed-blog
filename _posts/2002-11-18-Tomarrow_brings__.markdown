one of three choices:<br/>
<blockquote>
<small>Fiery death from a high rise building<br/>
<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/story.jsp?story=353280">War!</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miami/4530780.htm">Nuclear</a> War<br/>
<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/17/60minutes/main529657.shtml">Bush's</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/11/17/nkorea.nukes/index.html">Missile Crisis</a><br/>
Corporate office job<br/></small>

So many choices. I will choose Office job. Thank you.<br/> Apparently 
<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101021125-390894,00.html">Gore</a> doesn't much like Bush's economic strategy. I don't much like Bush's call for a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61549-2002Nov15.html">Domestic spy agency</a>. I get scared enough when they start appropriating <a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/border/21115TOMBSTONEBORDER2fmst2fj.html">private militia</a> for government use, let alone when my tax dollars pay for me to get arrested for haveing a liberal anti-war website - <b>eep</b>.<br/><br/>
Anyway, so today I updated my <a href="http://www.harperreed.org/portfolio">portfolio</a>. It is fun to recap on all the projects I have done. I love writing the little captions. Heh. I am a dork. In other news 3gscreensaver went out and purchased me a nice new TV. Whee. Now the new LOTR 4 dvd set will look tremendous. I am so excited.
