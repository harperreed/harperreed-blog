Morbid angel is one of those bands that creates a sound that shouldn't be coming from humans. It is so rough. The drummer is insane. They all had the requisite metal hair, however they used big fans to blow it past their faces ...

I saw <a href="http://www.imotorhead.com/index2.htm">motorhead</a> last night. It was so so loud and my head wanted to die. Morbid angel and Today is the Day also played. Morbid angel is one of those bands that creates a sound that shouldn't be coming from humans. It is so rough. The drummer is insane. They all had the requisite metal hair, however they used big fans to blow it past their faces and heads. it looked so cool. For morbid angel I was really close to the mosh pit,  which is something I have not done in awhile.. I usually run from that sort of thing. I must have felt especailly tough last night. ;) <br/><br/>check out <a href="http://zippotricks.com/flesh_torch1/flesh_torch1.html">this</a>.. be sure and watch the videos in order.
