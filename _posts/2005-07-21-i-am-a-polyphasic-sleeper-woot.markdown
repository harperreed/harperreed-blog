After some discussion with my new friend <a href="http://mediadiet.net/">heath</a> he pointed me to <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/m/j/mjy135/About/polyphasic.html">this</a> and then i found <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/15/103358/720">this</a> link that had seen before. 

I don't think that the uberman schedule is for me. but i do think that polyphasic sleep is good.

hehe.
