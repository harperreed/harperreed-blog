but I called the <a href="http://www.yoyoguy.com">yoyo guys</a>, and they have found my package. it was returned. whew. my yoyos will live... again.. <br/><br/>Yesterday was nice. I went after work to visit marcia at the art institute, we then went to <a href="http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Dining-bubbletea!PlaceDetail-20521,00.html">Joy Yee</a> on a whim and had food and great fruit shakes. I love when hanging out is good. like.. not silly or pretentious.. just chill.. <br/><br/>after that I went to busy beaver and got the virgin tears and unemployable buttons and then went and to the pelican/melt banana show. it was great. I really enjoyed pelican. they were so tight. it is enjoyable. <br/><br/>today, I have been playing this fun flash game called <a href="http://www.xgenstudios.com/castle/index.htm">castle</a>. check it out. it isn't really hard until you get past the 8th or 9th level.. then it gets hard ;)
