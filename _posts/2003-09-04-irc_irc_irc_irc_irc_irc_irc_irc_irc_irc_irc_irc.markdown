so today on IRC my friend <a href="http://corp.beercan.com/view.php?channel=corporate&date=1062651600">clock was attacked</a> by a group iof hooligans who flooded her off and stole her nick. they then came back to start trouble. 
and trouble was started. we made fun of the channels this one guy was on: 

<b>#ryan1918 #Radio+ #god.hates.fags #concepthosting #whipcream #novascotia #metal #linux-help #kozekanal #b?smoen #chatlife</b> and then kicked him. he got mad and DOSd my box. after 10 minutes of not being able to get to my box. everything popped back to life. so I messaged him to find out what/how much it took - etc etc.

So it appears I took a bit of bandwidth. but my nick stayed connected - which obviously surprised him (and me). it just got very very lagged. ah the joys of colo. and what a surprise that he is in school. anyway..
