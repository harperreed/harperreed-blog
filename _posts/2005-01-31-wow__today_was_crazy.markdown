so after a week of work that last about 64+ hours I am about to fall asleep - even though I went to bed soo damned early last night that I don't remember seeing the sunrise. haha. umm. everything is sorta breaking. every couple months I get the feeling that the ceiling is falling. but. I don't care ;) haha. I will hoist it back up. <br/><br/>so my site is almost done. now is time to start the others. I thought up a bunch of great ideas on my way to work today. I was able to <a href="http://www.ironkungfu.net">document them</a> and hopefully will be playing with them more in the future. <br/><br/>i need much much better money management skills. stupid stupid stupid money.
