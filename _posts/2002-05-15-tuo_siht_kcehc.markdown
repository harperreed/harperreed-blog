Today I made a dtd. This isn't really exciting so to speak. But it is quite fun for me. In my head anyway. I really enjoy stupid shit like that. It cracks me up. Last night the phone rang like 5 minutes after I went to sleep.. at like 1:45 or so... and I when I got up to answer the phone I glanced over and noticed a glowing ball of spirits next to my bed. they slowly dissipated.. mostly because I was talking delieriously on the phone. It was quite interesting. I laughted a bunch. I don't know if the humor transcended my dreary state however. <br/><br/>Today I was invited to help with projects for a new mindstorms book. heh. How fun. I hope I win. haha.
