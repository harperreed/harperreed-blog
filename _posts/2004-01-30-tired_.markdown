staying up for work is killing me. haha. even thought it was a couple days ago. I obviously need to take this weekend and sleep in. when I just typed sleep.

I hate keyboards. they are mean to me. <br/><br/>check out <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040122-5.html">this awesome dialogue</a> between our AWESOME <a href="http://nata2.info/humor/bush/badman.jpg">president</a> and a member of the press.
