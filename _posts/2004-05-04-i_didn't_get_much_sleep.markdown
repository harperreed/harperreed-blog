title: i didn't get much sleep
excerpt: but I did manage to arrive to work at a decent time. not the 4:00 I feared while attempting to fall asleep last night at 4:00am. I don't look well rested. heh. hopefully in a couple minutes/hours/days. haha. I need a nap. already. and I barely got up a couple minutes ago. heh...

I don't <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1083678359-Nokia6600(624).jpg">look well rested</a>. heh. hopefully in a couple minutes/hours/days. haha. I need a nap. already. and I barely got up a couple minutes ago. heh. <br/><br/>a movie was being filmed on the way to work today. it was pretty crazy. mostly cuz all of a sudden there was a billion people on my way to work. and it didn't make sense. I wonder what movie/who/whatever. I imagine it was oceans 12 or whatever. heh. hmm.
