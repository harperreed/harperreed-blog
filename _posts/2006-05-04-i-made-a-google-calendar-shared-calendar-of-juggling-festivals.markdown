I searched and couldn't find a really solid convention calendar so I made one. Here is the shared feed

<a href="ttp://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/lc23uj0p7jk63um7gahur7odek@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic"><img src="http://www.google.com/calendar/images/xml.gif" /></a> <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/lc23uj0p7jk63um7gahur7odek@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic"><img title="iCal Feed" alt="iCal Feed" src="http://www.google.com/calendar/images/ical.gif" /></a>

Check it out. Let me know if there are additions or changes. Honestly i just wanted to get it out there. If someone wants admin access - let me know.

Also. I will be at The Stevenson Fest if anyone wants to meet up.
