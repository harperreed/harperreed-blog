So this weekend was pretty cool. I am reading another good japanese book. I have no idea why I am reading all the japanese dark ficiton I can get my hands on. I am currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802139914/qid=1094592192/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-5041001-6746318?v=glance&amp;s=books">Goodbye Tsugumi</a>. it is pretty bleak. I like it. next I  got like 3 murakami books waiting. hah. I am a dork. I like shotgun reading. it totally suits me. <br/><br/>after I read a bit and wrapped up my unpacking - I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0327056/">mystic river</a> - which I stole from my parents (i promise I will send them back soon :P). It was pretty good. <br/><br/>at some ppoint in the last couple days I redid the HTML on <a href="http://www.nata2.info">nata2.info</a>. it is a bit better now. no more tables. although tables are not bad. I really enjoy divs much more. <br/><br/>so this weekend. it all started on wednesday. heh. I <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042246/Nokia6600(439).jpg">flew to denver</a> and went to greeley. where I hung out with my family and married my brother.<br/>
haha<br/>saw him married I guess.. <br/>anyway. so wednesday night jon and I went to the dugout and drank beers. it was fun. but we had drank too much to drive home and I didn't have a license. so we <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042246/Nokia6600(447).jpg">walked home</a>. it was pretty <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042246/Nokia6600(449).jpg">funny</a>. we were picked up by this nice guy who dropped us off near my house. the next day we all got up early. I went and renewed my license. and  ran some errands/got reservations for my bros little <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party">bachelor get together</a>. <br/><br/>dylan really wanted to go to dave and busters - so <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party/IMG_1283.jpg">we</a> all piled into this <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party&img=IMG_1284.jpg">bus</a> and drove to dave and busters in westminister. We drank a bunch of <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party/IMG_1291.jpg">champagne</a> and quite a few mixed drinks and beers. we had purchased a bunch of liquor in an attempt to get dylan to drink a lot. haha. we got some deserno for deserno and coke. and then some redbull and ketel one. yea know.. the usual. there was a really <a href="http://www.bevnet.com/reviews/dickenscider/">funny cider we got</a> as well. so then we arrived - had a big dinner. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party&img=IMG_1305.jpg">dylan and jon</a> did this disgusting shot with 151, jager, midori and some others. it was nasty. but it <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party&img=IMG_1304.jpg">looked cool</a>. we were all tired - so we went home after that. <br/><br/>on friday. we hung out and ran errands again. then there was the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042233/Nokia6600(458).jpg">rehersal</a>. and a bunch of <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042233/Nokia6600(457).jpg">face</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042233/Nokia6600(456).jpg">making</a>. it was <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042239/Nokia6600(455).jpg">pretty awesome</a>. then we had a big dinner for everyone and just generally hung out. after the dinner we went to walmart to buy supplies for the wedding and found the magical and exciting silly string. it ruled. we then <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A04_dylans_wedding&img=IMG_1320.jpg">attacked my dad</a>. it was very funny. <br/><br/>then saturday happened.
