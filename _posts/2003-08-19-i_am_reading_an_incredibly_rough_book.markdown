it isn't hard per se. it is just rough. it is called <u>Into That Darkness</u>. it is about the <a href="http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/gallery/pg15/pg6/pg15687.html">Franz Stangl</a> the commandant of <a href="http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t078/t07868.html">treblinka</a>. When I first started reading the book - I thought "oh.. I can handle this.. it won't be rought.. I have read about this stuff before." little did I know.. <br/>i think what is hard for me to understand is how workers at the extermination camps seemed to rationalize the killing. I can see how a government can get fucked up enough to start killing. I can see how a group can get misguided enough to start killings.. but I can't understand how the people who worked there.. who were just "doing there jobs." those people I do not get. it is totally confusing and baffeling. I also do not understand - why at the extermination camps.. they had to maintain the charade that they were not actually  extermination camps to the people coming in to be exterminated. I understand why they needed to do this at first.. you can't have people just coming off of the trains to die. you had to organize them and what not. . but why did they have to dehumanize them and such. heh. of course.. I am not the first to ask this. heh. nor will I be the last. <br/><br/>i hope this never happens again.
