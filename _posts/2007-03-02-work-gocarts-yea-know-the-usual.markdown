So we got gocarts at work. It is pretty awesome. I grew up with gocarts - so driving fast around is second nature and great fun. Everyday I come in and Jake is driving around our space in the gocart - zooming around desks and generally having a great time. I am surprised someone hasn't died. but yea.

here are some videos.

The <a href="http://www.craigshimala.com/v/2274/skinnycart_64">first</a> shows me and Jake driving the gocarts. especially fun is when I take off my pants to drive the gocart around the block. I didn't want my pants to get dirty. yea know...  <a href="http://www.craigshimala.com/v/2274/skinnycart_64">here is the video.</a>

The <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/clip:148137">second video</a> is being chased by Jacobs death bronco. Jake almost dies. it is amazing. <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/clip:148137">Check it out</a>.

I really can't wait until the weather gets better and we can really unload the gocarts.

Hope you like them.
