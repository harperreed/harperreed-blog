My friend <a href="http://in5anity.org">Jon</a> got an article written about him in our hometown newspaper. <a href="http://www.greeleytrib.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Site=GR&amp;Date=20030116&amp;Category=OUTDOORS&amp;ArtNo=301150011&amp;Ref=AR&amp;SectionCat=FEATURES">Check it out</a>. He walked a long way.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/cnet/stories/980889.htm">Wierd</a> - there is apparently a small amount of opposition to the government having a "super database" of information against us citizens. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030116-72466627.htm">And in a shocking move</a> the US decides that N. Korea is not a threat after all... wtf.. heh. luckly we are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A667-2003Jan16.html">registering</a> people who are suspected terrorists.. I mean obviously everyone from egypt is a terrorist.. and everyone from Bangladesh is a terrorist and everyone from Jordan,Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Syria are terrorists. could you imagine the problems that would occur if france required all U.S. citizens to register. heh. bush would get all upset and maybe say some dumb words. or somthing. But maybe IRAQ is hiding <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/01/16/sproject.irq.wrap/index.html">things</a>..<br>
<br>
I noticed that I don't really make sense. but.. whatever.. heh
