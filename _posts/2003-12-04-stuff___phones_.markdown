I have been playing with my phone for awhile and looking for great sites at the same time.. so my friend mike found and sent me <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/">this</a> which is really exciting. that site led me to <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">this one</a> which has some good info. <br/><br/>i will be submitting stuff to it soon. wheee!<br/><br/>tonight I am cleaning. it sucks. I hate the damned housework. I have three projects I need to finish. my phone photolog, adopt a cholo, and my secret host project. ---- I DON"T HAVE TIME... hehe. well sorta.
