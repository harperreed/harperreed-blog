title: Imperialism
excerpt: Hey yall, I have been reading some books for the last couple of months that deal with the after effects of imperialism. Why is it that the nature of humanity is to destroy/assimilate culture and life of others. I find this disturbing, but mostly because it is an easy racket to get involved in. Is it hard, to maintain a cultural identity within the pseudo "melting pot" of the U.S.
