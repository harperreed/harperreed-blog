happy xmas.

i made my photo frame ibook work. it rules. I just <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/251220041531/Nokia6600(148).jpg">mounted it into</a> a picture frame shadow box, and BAM. <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/251220041531/Nokia6600(144).jpg">fanciness</a>. it rules that you can remove EVERYTHING from an ibook and still have it function properly. hehe
