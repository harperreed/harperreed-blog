work is fun. <br/><br/>however for the past 12 hours - my sternum has felt like it needed to be "popped." like a back. it sucks. it kinda hurts when I breath. I hope I am not dieing. heh. <br/><br/>today I am not a fan of Harry Angstrom. I am annoyed at how hard he is on his son. <br/><br/>me and my friends have been playing <a href="http://mediamammon.drunkmenworkhere.org/about.php">media mammon</a> maniacally. it rules. basically you pick words to trade on a market - but the market value of each word is detirmined by the density of that word in the news. so it is pretty weird. currently <a href="http://mediamammon.drunkmenworkhere.org/portfolio.php?uid=2607">i have made</a> around $1200 from the initial 250 they give you. it check it constantly. I want to WIN. WIN I say.  but I am unable to. <br/><br/>sigor ros is pretty.
