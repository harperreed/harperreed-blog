Last night I tried to goto bed early. but I was tricked by something. I am not sure what. But something kept me up. I had a lot of weird dreams about moving from my cubicle to a strange undisclosed location and losing my headphones.. or something it was confusing. <br/><br/>Last night I emailed myself regarding a weblog post I was supposed to make. here it is:<ul>
<li>My <a href="http://www.in5anity.org">friend jon</a> spent some time on the PCT and also spent some time hanging out with <a href="http://www.sf.indymedia.org/news/2002/10/1534270.php">these lovely ladies</a>. He is in the last picture in the blue shirt. ;)
<li>I added the boobies script ot dopeman. check it out <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/boobies/?text=nata2.org">here</a>.</li>
<li>Apparently the boobies script was made by <a href="http://www.slbs.net">slbs.net</a> - which is a pretty nice weblog.</li>
<li>politically I think that our country <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2002/11/07/minnesota/index_np.html">is</a> broken. I <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/commentary/moyers15.html">fear</a> what is about to occur in the "<a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-prof09.html">free</a>" world. It is sad that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38472-2002Nov11.html">war machine</a> is so comprehensive, and is so threatening to the <a href="http://googlism.com/index.htm?ism=freedom&type=1">freedom</a> we all love so dearly. I get sad. I am not a fan of bush. I don't think anyone is - however wtf is the deal with the GOP winning everything. <a href="http://www.bitchmech.com">jesus</a>!</li>
<li>So last night we saw davidson's movie. It was quite good. It is so refreshing when your friends produce really great things. I enjoy it. I am <a href="http://www.dopeman.org">blessed</a> with a great number of very talented friends. whee.</li>
</ul>
well that is certainly enough.
