again. BAM sucka. I feel I should post something awesome to make up for my lame complaining last post. I guess I will give it a shot. <a href="http://www.suzuki.com.au/TWIN.asp">this car</a> is pretty dope. it woudl be fun. a super mini hybrid. I could carry it up the stairs and such. <a href="http://upcoming.org/">this site</a> coudl someday be cool. but it might turn into a <a href="http://dodgeball.com">dodgeball</a> type of thing - where it seems cool but in actuality is too hard to actually participate in. I don't know what this is <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/network/2002/03/08/cory_google.html">about</a>. really. I have no idea. I suppose I could find <a href="http://heatherw.com/mk/endorse/teenread.htm">out easy enough</a>. I really can't wait for my books to arrive. it will be awesome. &lt;3.<br>

i don't want to leave my house.
