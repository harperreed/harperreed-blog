yesterday I went to an estate sale. it sucked. but I found a great picture of mary. It is so nice. I hope I don't fall into the collection habit I once had. oh the misery of my walls.. garnished in jesus memoriablia. I got home.. watched a skate video. whee. and then ate mexican food. then simpsons. then sleep. then walked in rain. then sleep. wait.
