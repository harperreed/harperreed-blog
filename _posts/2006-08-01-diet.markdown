so i am not a large person. i am no where near little either. I grew up really skinny and just in the last few years have gained weight. Recently i noticed that i gained a belly. Not the ironic funny belly -  but a legit paunch. I don't really want a paunch - and after talking to some friends who are quiet well taken care of they mentioned that it most likely is the fact that i snack a lot and drink about 300 pops a day. So i am trying something different.

I am going to try and not drink pop for a month and not snack as much. I have never in my life attempted such a feat. I have always eaten what i want when i want. so this will be quite an interesting move.

heh.
