<p>My Comcast cable Internet&nbsp;has been out 4 times in the last 2 months. It is killing me. When speakeasy used to go out (very rarely), I would call them and they would fix it. I never had to have a technician come to my home and check out my DSL modem. But with Comcast, every problem - even when they admit that it is probably in the wiring leading to the house - they insist on sending a technician and wasting my time.&nbsp; Why do they insist on wasting peoples time?</p> <p>I am so tired of it. If <a href="http://www.rcn.com/">RCN cable</a> was available to my house - I would have it in a second. It is so bad that I am tempted to go back to speakeasy - even though it would be much much slower. I would even pay much more money to not have to deal with Comcast ever again. </p> <p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22I+HATE+Comcast.%22">I HATE Comcast.</a> </p> <p>Seriously. If someone is reading this and they are from comcast. I hate your company. I can't even begin to vocalize my disdain for the horrible service&nbsp;I have continued to receive. </p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: So it turns out that all those times&nbsp;I told comcast that the outage was not me and was them - was correct. They called me tonight and left a message saying: "We have identified and fixed an outage in your area. Thank you." I still hate them!</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:feaa6134-71fb-4904-b07e-6eb874cf5418" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]comcast sucks, comcast, internet, cable internet, outage, annoying[/tags]</div>
