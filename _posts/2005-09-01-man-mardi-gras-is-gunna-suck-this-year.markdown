seriously. new orleans got knocked the fuck down. It is amazing how nature can take a piece of something that we think is strong and then remove our conception of strength without even thinking of it. I remember reading the other day about how the hurricane had POUNDED miami and it was going to disrupt the VMAs (oh my god!!) - but no one had even an inkling of how powerful and destructive it could end up being.  I guess we now know. I think it is insane that the governor of louisiana is saying that new orleans needs to be abandoned. i wonder if we will rebuild it - or if it will be under water. i heard that it is a city that is below sea level and near the mouth of a river and near a lake and near the ocean - that seems like a bad place for a city.  eh.. i guess we all learn from our mistakes.. 

if you haven't - you should donate money to the relief fund. IT IS IMPORTANT.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/philanthropy/red-cross.html/002-7291545-6512808">go here to donate through amazon. </a> Please do this. 

in other words.. today at <a href="http://skinnycorp.com">skinnyCorp</a> we all hung out and worked (of course) - until jacob got his 6 nerf pistols. we then threw down some <a href="http://skinnycorp.com">skinnyCorp</a> vs. <a href="http://threadless.com">threadless</a> justice. it ruled. quite fun. I have fixed and built my new work computer - so tomorrow i will really start working. only took one week to get settled in. i guess i need some shelves and such to make things really nice. i gotta create a home for my homies.  and for my yoyos

yea know. yoyos. i love them.

i need to fix my photolog. i will do that now. 

so. i HATE movies that have uncomfortable situations.. seriously - along came polly, bottlerocket, and the like. the uncomfortableness makes me really uncomfortable. haha. so much so that i am pausing hitch and then fast forwarding it cuz i can't deal with it. it grates on my nerves. but like a horror movie - its nice and fun to have those feelings. although it KILLS me. KILLS. i may have to stop watching and goto bed.
