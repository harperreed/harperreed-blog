so i was hanging out at work. and i decided to check up on some blogs as a pat on the back for doing good work - and i checked this <a href="http://troubador.typepad.com/amorous_troubador/">blog </a>i read of this women who went to <a href="http://cornellcollege.edu">cornell </a>and was an aquaintence of mine and friends or my friends.. anyway.. on her blog there was a mention of a friend of mine from college who i had lost touch with -  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/hh/1742061/HH/1742061/iid_890186.jpg?path=pgallery&path_key=Hershey,%20Portis">cecil </a>- who is apparently working in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1742061/">film</a>. hah. rule. it is so funny. especially because his name is portis hershey - which is what he told me once was the name he was going to use when he was famous. haha. 

i always wondered what happened to cecil. now i know. ;)

here is a <a href="http://people.cornellcollege.edu/m-myers/PortisHershey.htm">webpage about cecil</a> from my college. 

the internet rules. i gotta go rent extreme dodgeball now.
