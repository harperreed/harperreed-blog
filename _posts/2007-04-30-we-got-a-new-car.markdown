<p><img height="187" src="http://images4.worldcarfans.com/photos/3050929.001/1008.jpg" width="250" align="right">So Hiromi and I got a new car. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Versa">A Nissan Versa</a>. It is not a big car. It is tiny and has good safety ratings. Hiromi is currently driving it back from colorado. I am excited to see it. I am not sure but it may feature a continuously variable transmission. Which would be really neat. Regardless - it will not be a gas guzzler and will be small enough to park on city streets. </p> <p>I am probably going to make it look like a <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/images/The_Auto_Blog/nissanversa.jpg">spaceship</a>. </p> <p>Hiromi will be using it to commute to work. And to steal upright video games for all of our friends. </p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:dde704ab-a3f5-4d85-adaa-d7520c680429" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]car, nissan, work[/tags]</div></p>
