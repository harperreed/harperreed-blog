<p>this weekend was a good time. I flew to minneapolis to engage in a <a href="http://www.mondofest.org/" target="_self">juggling festival</a>. it ruled. I saw lots of cool friends. sadly tomorrow is work. <br /><br />hey all my far away friends (i.e. bec, <a href="http://www.mimiblume.com/" target="_self">miriam</a> and <a href="http://home.kimo.com.tw/pzantique/" target="_self">ella</a>) I am now on <a href="http://www.skype.com/" target="_blank">skype</a> - you should &quot;skype me&quot; - or call - or whatever. I hooked my bluetooth headset up to my mini mac and now have a fanciful &quot;voipish&quot; internet phone. unfortunantly no one can call me. but I can call anyone else. ;) haha. rule. if this works well. I may end up purchasing one of those fancy skype phones. this way everyone can make long distance calls from here. it could/should rule.</p><p>quite a bit of my sites are finally up. I hope they work. I recently figured out how to do php-&gt;pdf. that rules. </p><p>ok</p><p>sleep </p>
