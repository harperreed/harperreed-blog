<p>I just read this article. It is about an Iraq Veteran and his battle with post-traumatic stress. Pretty intense - but worth reading. You can check out the article <a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-100/essay1007">here</a> - even better, read the <a href="http://www.esquire.com/print-this/essay1007">full version here</a>. Its very well written and a solid read. I guess its pretty somber, but it seems to be truth. </p> <p>Man. The US is in&nbsp;a weird weird place right now.</p>
