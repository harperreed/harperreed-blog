i am rather burned out. i have been working with php-mvc frameworks and they are making me not feel smart. it is totally bumming me out.  

i need some help. some change. someone to punch me in the eye. eep cryptic. heh. i am soo bored. i guess i just need to represent and figure out what is going on. 

eeeek. so frustrated. 

time is moving so slow today. i spent 4 hours from 3-5 today. it sucked. and the last two hours have been hell too. mostly cuz i am ftustrated at my computer. however i did manage to make some headway - however small it really was. 

oh OH OH!! much more fun then my depressed rants is this: <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming%2Fphotoshopped_harper">Photoshopped pictures of me!!</a> go ahead and contribute some. they will make everyone happy. i promise.

also.. umm... i forgot.  
oh yea. i think i am going to goto coachella. i will be attempting to change the lives of people i meet with technology. oh yes i will. OH YES. i love rock.
