So today I got up.. got right to work. did a little bit of financial planning.. played with bank statements and suddenly noticed a very large charge from sprintpcs. so I called them and they suck. really. they suck so so much. they alleged that I received two phones, started a new service contract and then canceled. thus invoking about $600 of charges. So I talked to them and they have a different "story" on what happened and refuse to refund 400 of the 600. fuckin sweet. so angry. increidbly angry. I hate them. they are sooooooo frustrating. <br/><br/>so last night I saw <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/shows/fischerspooner_heat_2003">fischerspooner</a> again. it was fun.<br/><br/>i am tired. there is not enough time in the day. it is annoying. I need like 10 more hours. and some more money. and a girlfriend. and a nice condo. and about 2 years of vacation. thanks.
