i listened to cat power on the way to work. man. that music is sad. hah. I think one of my favorite songs by her is "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=2960659&amp;selectedItemId=2960635">good</a> <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Good-Woman-lyrics-Cat-Power/744491FBEBC1CBE748256D41000D087E">women</a>." hmm. kinda sad. ;)<br/><br/>last night was pretty fun. I went and saw black print at the double door, then I went and I hung out with severn and val at danny's. it was fun to hang out with them. I realized while walking to danny's by myself - that I really shoudln't just hang out with my room. unlike some of my friends, I get a lot of power from hanging out wiht people. it makes me go. heh. and the last couple days I have hung out with my room, my rommmates and morgan. all of which has been good. but I haven't really hung out with my friends. so last night. I did that and it ruled. heh. so anyway.. after I hung out at danny's I went to the big horse (ugh) and saw matt and erica's band play. they were really good. it was pretty cool. I hope they get some good gigs. I would like to see them at a legit venue (rather than the big horse). hah. then I somehow managed to goto club foot, and then somehow I managed to make it to the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060520040916/Nokia6600(656).jpg">hollywood grill</a>. seriously. wtf. I have no idea how I can do that (the food heh). but yea. <br/><br/>i end up waiting for emails far too often. I hate that. <br/><br/>i need to pack. right now everything is grouped appropriately. however it isn't packed right. I need to make sure I have everything. I am scared about that. I imagine it will work out. unless I forget my passport in frankfurt or something. hah. <br/><bR><a href="http://proxientunit.com/">mike</a> and nic are coming over tonight. they are flying currently. it will be really nice to see them. if only for the couple hours. <br/><br/>work ho..
