i remembered that <a href="http://www.simple-answer.com/">mark verbos</a> was playing his live set at smartbar (and by remember i mean greg told me).  It was amazing. Verbos is quite something. i love distortion and hearing it build and seeing him do his little knob thing. haha. so good. i took <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F260820050159">some pictures</a>. He has <a href="http://www.simple-answer.com/MarkVerbos_LiveAcid.mp3">posted an MP3</a> of what he basically did tonight (albeit tonight was quite a bit harder). you should check it out. 

who wants to buy me a 6680?
