i was able to fix my <a href="photolog.php">photolog</a> in like 3 minutes. it worked out FINE. hah. the pictures from the phone are 640x480 so quite a bit bigger than the previous demensions. however. I think the next step will be hooking GD into the photolog software to create thumbnails. heh. I think it will be worth it. and it will rule. RULE I say. <br/><br/>i am able to bypass MMS and use the email client on the phone to send the images. it is annoying. but honestly no harder than the T610. I just wish it was all automagic. maybe I shoudl write an app to solve this problem. <br/><br/>i just got a bit sad. 
<br/><br/>i am also test a <a href="http://nata2.org/?mode=div">version of my blog</a> that uses <a href="http://nata2.org/?mode=div">div tags</a> rather than full tables. it is a little bit more accessable. I wish I could figure out floating <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/liquid/">liquid layouts</a> better.
