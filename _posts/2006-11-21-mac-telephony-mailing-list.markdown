<p>The OSX/Mac voip community has a new mailing list. It is located the <a href="http://lists.mactelephony.net/mailman/listinfo/mac-telephony-list">The Macintosh Telephony Mailing List</a> site. The list will cover all sorts of interesting voip/mac topics and won't be just a bunch of asterisk peeps talking about asterisk. It should have a bundle of information about turning a mac mini into a full featured PBX and what not. It will turn out to be a great place for Mac voip information and contacts.</p>
<p>Check it out.
