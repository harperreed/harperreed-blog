<p>You know when you are speaking and you are have a word stuck in your head and you can't quite think what it is. it is on the tip of your tongue&nbsp;or whatever. Well for the past couple weeks, whenever someone mentions jabber, gtalk or xmpp or whenever I start thinking about those topics - I feel like I have some idea that is stuck in my head. Its killing me. Seriously. All I do is think about writing code that integrates jabber with this, or with that - however nothing satisfies or helps me find the stuck idea. I guess I need to start hacking away a bit more. </p> <p>Its almost as though I have 3 parts to a 5 part puzzle. And I am unable to even visualize what those other parts are. </p> <p>Hopefully once I figure this out -&nbsp;it will cause me to become even&nbsp;more amazing&nbsp;than I&nbsp;already am.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:1b891f36-f949-4c6d-bd00-fae81b366f3d" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]thinking, projects, jabber, ideas, hacking[/tags]</div>
