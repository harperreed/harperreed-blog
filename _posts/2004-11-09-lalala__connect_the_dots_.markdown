this morning I woke up early. like 7:00. I was having a dream wher ei was invader zim and I was able to time travel (a combination of the two things I did last night between 2:30am and 4:00am). it ruled. I just buzzed around and had time traveling problems. I am currently reading this book by authur c clarke. it rules. I forgot what it is called. I have not bothered to look at the titles of the last two or three books. I find it interesting. I have also read a damned lot in the past couple weeks/months. it kinda rules. I shoudl reallystart a book log. haha. that lists all the books I have read and what I thought of them. it might be interesting. maybe I will do that. maybe I will. maybe. I will.<br>

punctuation is sometimes annoying<br>

i don't think I have one good friend who hasn't commented on the lack of blog entries I have made since I started my new job. it is cool to see that people are reading my blog. but it is sorta annoying that I have that as a following. I mean. I never did it expecting that I would be expected to do it again soon. heh. yea know. I just do it right now. and then if I do it again soon. it is almost a coincidence that I continue everyday. I never realized that people read it. haha. even thought he stats tell me otherwise. I may be stuck in my own universe. hmm. could I be?<br>
<br>
i miscalculated my pay periods and I have totally screwed myself. haha. rule. I shoudl plan ahead more. and plan on buying less stuff. stupid buying. stupid money. nata2 is in dire straits. we shall see how this turns out. I think possibly ok. but eep. I hope so.<br>
<br>
stupid money<br>

oh oh oh. I purchased a new dvd player and haxored it into being region free. I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/107-8488385-1006951?tag=nata2productions&amp;mode=blended&amp;keyword=cyberhome">Cyberhome CH-DVD 320</a> at target for $38.00. it is about the size of a large 80s portable cd player. heh. or about the size of a sega genesis (sorta with a bit shaved off and it looks cooler). so I haxored it real easy like:
<blockquote><small>Turn on power (with no disc inserted)<br>
Press Menu, 1, 9<br>
Select the Region option and press Enter<br>
Key number of desired region or 0 for region free<br>
Press Enter again to save changes<br>
Press Eject and insert your DVD</small></blockquote>
now it plays ALL my dvds without fail. we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363226/">Zat?ichi</a>. it was incredible. next is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308379/">dark water</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0269266/">nightmare</a>, then <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338763/">battle royal 2</a>, then whatever and then whatever, and then whatever. it rules. I can order from hivizone with reckless abandon (whereas before I was so so conservative with my 100s of hong kong dvd orderings). you can never have <a href="http://dopeman.org/movies/">enough</a> I guess....<br>

politics are dumb. tonight I get to go see fear factory. then to see the movie the grudge. I am excited. although really hungry. ;)
