<p>So I just got back from visiting Hiromi's relatives in the Yamanashi prefecture. We had a big New Years celebration and had a lot of fun. As you may or may not know, in Japan, New Years is quite big. It is a lot like a combination of Thanksgiving and Christmas. So while I was away for New Years, I had no access to the Internet. For almost 4 days. It was really neat. I didn't think about email or my servers or work or anything for 4 days.&nbsp; well... maybe 3 days.. the last day I was starting to get a bit antsy - but I made it. </p> <p>There is no such thing as Internet addiction. hah. </p> <p>More on my japan trip later. If you want, I have <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157594444547976/">created a set of pictures</a> I have taken thus far. </p>
