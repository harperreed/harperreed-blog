So i got gmail back this morning. had a bundle of mail that i didn't get to see yesterday. weird. What was really annoying was that google didn't respond and that there hasn't been a response before. It just seems that they are ignoring a problem. Even if they were like "oh your email is broken until tomorrow" that would be better. it was rather frustrating..

maybe it is time to move to yahoo..

hah. nah. i like gmail.

stay tuned for my write up of windows on a macbook pro
