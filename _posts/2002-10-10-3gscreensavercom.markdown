I started out simply enough with the a500hacking.com website, but i soon noticed that the audience for that site had grown, and was hammering my server. I was also getting quite a few donations and noticed that a lot of people seemed interested in giving me more of their hard earned money. So i created this page. It basically allows for anyone to create a "locker" to hold all of their personal pictures that they want to be able to put on their phone. It also allows people to upload ringtones and store them. BMI and the like had a small problem with this idea - so i had to remove the public ringtones and put some very stringent ringtone managment policies in effect. After one month the site has remained rather successful and has pretty much ran itself.
