I remember when a friend of mine used to allude to my relationships as weather. He would ask how the weather was. I would always respond with some equally vague answer. It was fun. Today I went to watch breakdancing. It would have been fun, if it hadn't been canceled. suxors. However. rigth before break dancing I talked to a new friend on the phone for quite awhile. It was nice. It is fun to meet neew people. I hope we hang out a lot. hehe. crush crush.<br/><br/>I really wish that the news wasnt so biased. Why does the media trick us so. It frustratedd me so much. I can't even deal with it. Today Matiss gave me a comic. Now my life is ruined. heh. another hobby is not what I need. Well anyway. I sometimes wonder if a weblog is detrimental to a persons notion of privacy.
