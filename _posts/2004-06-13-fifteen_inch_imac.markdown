so yesterday at work we <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086977484-Nokia6600(895).jpg">watched the movie</a> startup.com. it was pretty good. a quite sad story really. it made me want to be involved in a startup again. haha. I say agan like I was involved in one during the .com wars. I am a liar. I wasn't. in fact I don't even have arms.
<br/><br/>after the movie I secured myself an <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086986287-Nokia6600(898).jpg">imac</a> that is totally broken. haha. somehow it got friend. and when they plugged it in at work - it broke about 10 power strips and a couple of comptuers. doh. so I gotta fix it. I have a feeling that if I replace the power supply it will fix everything. haha. hopefully. I don't want to blow everything else up. by everything else - I mean the tv. so anyway. I got it. and I carried it <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087008844-Nokia6600(899).jpg">home</a>. I rule. it was hilarious to carry it on the train during rush hour. so today I <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087093976-Nokia6600(901).jpg">took the imac apart</a> to figure out what the deal was. and I wore it as a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087094678-Nokia6600(903).jpg">hat</a>.<br/><br/>yesterday I wore one of my <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086978962-Nokia6600(896).jpg">"crazy" shirts</a> from india. it makes me look <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086986198-Nokia6600(897).jpg">crazy</a>.<br/><br/>last night I went to lava lounge with a bunch of friends. and evertually*as always) made it to crobar. and then smartbar. my cell phone camera does not <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087026914-Nokia6600(900).jpg">work well in crobar</a>.  however my little midget camera does <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/events/2004:06:11_lava_crobar">work better</a>. 

<br/><bR>i almost forgot.. I finished anna karenina. it ruled. th ending was good. I wasn't surprised. I am now going to reattempt gravity's rainbow. wish me luck.
