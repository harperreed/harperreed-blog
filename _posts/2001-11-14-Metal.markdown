So I listen to metal. I don't mean to. It sort of follows me around. I assume it is because metal likes me. I mean, I could barely walk out of the CD store withou tthe entire Iron Maiden Catalog jumping into my pocket. WTF. But, there is a lot to metal I don't like - for instance, pantera. WTF. I do not like Pantera. So without further ado I point you to <a href="http://www.buddyhead.com/other/hessian/love/page/">this</a>(<a href="http://www.buddyhead.com/other/hessian/love/page2/">part 2</a>) site where they posted a fake personal ad to AOL from a non-existent "metal-chick." It shows the actual depravity of intelligence in and around the metal community.
