is such a hippie that he is concerned about that "fad" called global warming. apparently some big <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/970325.asp?0dm=N23DN">chuck of ice broke</a> and now everyone is all scared. it is supposed to be some <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%5CNation%5Carchive%5C200309%5CNAT20030918e.html">proof</a> that <a href="http://www.enn.com/direct/display-release.asp?objid=D1D1366D000000F786F82D88290D3829">global warming</a> is <a href="http://www.nzz.ch/2003/09/09/english/page-synd4218255.html">real</a>.

It is a good thing our <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/news.cfm?newsID=267">government is looking out for us.</a>. oh and I love <a href=" http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/7/2/185108.shtml">bush</a>. I will just mark global warming as one of the many many things that scares the hell out of me.
