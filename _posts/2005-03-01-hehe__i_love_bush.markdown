<p>check out <a title="boondocks" href="http://images.ucomics.com/comics/bo/2005/bo050228.gif" target="_blank">this</a> comic. so very very true. unfortunately it is being <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/02/tribune_kills_a.html" target="_blank">banned by newspapers</a> all over. too bad it is true. heh. I love shit like that. </p><p>Some really exciting things are going down right now. I am almost finished with my fathers site and should be moving on to another couple sites. I started another project and have bundles more to do. stupid projects. always taking my time. </p><p>one of the cooler projects I started is a port of the bbs door <a href="http://www.cripplesmash.com/" target="_blank">cripple smash</a>. it was a game me and my friends played in high school a bunch. but it was written to work on a bbs (as doors were :P) and we want to port it to become a PHP web app.&nbsp;i tracked down the <a href="http://www.cripplesmash.com/wiki/index.php/Benf" target="_self">author</a> a couple(5 years ago) and we talked about doing the port - but nothing came of it. so when he contacted me on Monday I jumped to action. <a href="http://www.cripplesmash.com/CS.0021/SMASH2.PNG" target="_self">it rules</a>. </p><p>i love neat things. </p><p>i am thinking about making a magnetic stripe reader. also writing a <a href="http://www.camophone.com/" target="_self">camophone</a> interface in <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,034-821,00.html" target="_self">python</a> for my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,54665,00.html" target="_blank">series 60 phone</a>. this would make things fun. I could be out and demo the <a href="http://www.camophone.com/" target="_self">camophone</a> capabilities to anyone. rule. </p><p>this weekend I am going to Colorado to help my parents with their website and to hang out with my cousins. I am pretty excited about being away again. I need more vacations. I need to start reading again. I finally got the rest of my fancy series. haha. stupid fantasy novels. I hate them - but they are so good. haha. totally cool. TOTALLY COOL. </p><p>ok. I really need to spend some time later and just move nata2 to its <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/nata2" target="_self">new design</a>. stupid sleep. as my friend <a href="http://blog.andrewcarlson.org/default.aspx" target="_self">andy</a> just said to me:</p><blockquote>(10:24:59) <strong>Andy Carlson:</strong> I think I am going to stop sleeping<br />(10:25:04) <strong>Andy Carlson:</strong> it takes too long </blockquote><p>So true. stupid sleep. maybe I will start using <a title="i need to stay awake in the air!!" href="http://www.cultural-baggage.com/tutruth/amphetamines[1].jpg" target="_blank">amphetamines</a>. that should solve the annoying sleep problem. ;) </p><p>check out my <a title="i rule" href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_7610/260220051806/Nokia7610(073).jpg" target="_blank">new shoes</a>.</p>
