Today I had another battle: me vs. pseudo-ephedrine and caffiene. I lost the battle, however I won the war. I finally got some nyquil so maybe I will actually sleep. I keep having waves of absolute exhaustion wash over me. woah. it is insane. But I am propping myself up against my cube with the sticks I collected at lunch and attempting to seem busy.<br/><br/>speaking of busy - I seriously rocked a meeting this morning/early afternoon. I think it was the combination of cold medicine/soda/insanity that made me so hott.. but whatever it was I was like a modded cyborg ready to strike. I jumped and swirved with the greatest of precision. I was like a hot blade in cold flesh. 
<br/>umm.. <br/><br/>i just got back from virgin with a bundle of dancehall cds. so good. I love it. more more more
