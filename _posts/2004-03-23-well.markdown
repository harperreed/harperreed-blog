<a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=884042">this</a> is an incredible headline. maybe the best <a href="http://www.fark.com">fark</a> headline I have ever seen. today I stumbled accross <a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/">banksy's</a> site. his stencil work is out of control. it was really busy this mornign so <a href="http://dopeman.org/mirrors/www.banksy.co.uk">i mirrored it</a>. I also <a href="http://www.picturesofwalls.com/banksy">ordered some of his work</a>. nice work. that is. <br/><br/>i am feeling very weird. my conversation with morgan last night gave me some much needed <a href="http://www.ambernet.kiev.ua/~dolinsky/anton/hope.jpg">hope</a>. but it also stirred all my emotions up into a mess of colors. it created a sense of <a href="http://www.sanctuaryproductions.bigstep.com/hope.jpg">hope</a> that I don't want to be false. I hate looking forward towards something that I really want to be true. once again the "planner" part of my personality gets involved and I start concentrating on this supposed future action. the problem being that I will end up  <a href="http://www.secretarmies.com/images/waiting.jpg">waiting</a> and <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/~nanr/nanr1.GIF">hopeing</a> for something that doesn't happen. I <a href="http://leitl.org/sylvia/hope.jpg">hope</a> that isn't the case  this time. <b>;)</b> it all seems very positive. so I am looking up towards <a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/img/h/a/harkness_r.jpg">jesus to guide me</a>. I feel, that however this turns out, it will be positive. I just really do miss her. <br/><br/>i just spent the last 8 minutes listening to an old <a href="http://www.digitalhardcore.com/news.asp">alec empire</a> track - wondering why my head/ears were confused. and before that I inadvertently listened to an AIR live track for 45 minutes. wtf. <br/><br/>here are some picture from last night. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&img=Img%28056%29.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&img=Img%28057%29.jpg">here</a> are the ibook being taken apart. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&img=Img%28055%29.jpg">here</a> is a comparison of my laptop with the ibook. hehe. I could hide my laptop inside the ibook. easily. hehe. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&img=Img%28060%29.jpg">here</a> is an action shot from home depot. rock!<br/><br/>so my new phone is pretty dope. however. I am having a hell of a time uploading pictures to the weblog. for some reason the mms is broked with tmobile. it totally sucks. cuz that is the only way I have to upload  pics. also. with the t610 it was super easy. like 4 clicks. with the  6600 it is a billion clicks. I guess it will be a lot better when MMS works. but I am still pissed. stupid wap 2.0. stupid euro phones.
