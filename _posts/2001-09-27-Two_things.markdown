First, I really miss block breaks. I am horribly stuck. I wish my company was a more liberal dot com. I wish it was 99-2000 and I was a high profile consultant.  I really wish that the company I work for was interested in making the employees happy. WHich they seemingly arn't. It seems that profit is the key, but even when I can identify things which are easy and would save money - getting them approved would cost more money then the initial savings. It is like pulling teeth. Very annoying and quite painful. Sometimes I wish a small consulting firm would snatch me up and I would leave this awful place. Well not quite, I do like my job, it is fun, it is interesting. But I know that their are other places that provide better benefits, better pay, free soda and where the developers of the web site have more control in what happens to the website. arghh.. well I think I will go and do work now :). I really do like it - just sometimes I get frustrated.
Secondly, well I forgot...
