Last night I went out to a seedy bar with some friends after work. Drank a little - helped another friend with web problems. and then went to some movies. I say some because we couldn't afford to goto the movie we wanted to goto. So we purchased tickets to a cheaper movie and then after an hour of the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0273923">cheaper movie</a>, we sneaked out and the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0192657">movie</a> we came to see was just starting.<br/><br/>
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0192657">Shiri</a> is arguably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was not at all what I expected. It was horribly sad, very violent and somewhat humorous. The <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Han,+Suk-kyu">cast</a> was incredible. They all did very very well. It wasn't a good valentines movie, and it really was <a href="http://us.imdb.com/CommentsShow?192657-1">quite sad</a>. However, iit was seriously one of the better movies I have ever seen.
