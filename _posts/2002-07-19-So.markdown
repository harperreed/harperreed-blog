i guess <a href="http://conagra.com/">conagra</a>, the company behind the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/magazine/JA01/meatpacking.html">beef</a> industry in my home town, recently <a href="http://www.greeleytribune.com/article.php?sid=9559">recalled</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/newswire/2002/07/19/rtr668374.html">18.6 million pounds</a> of ground beef. wtf. it is insanity. I hope no one dies. An interesting article about the beef industry is <a href="http://www.newtimes-slo.com/archives/cov_stories_2001/cov_07262001.html">here</a>. It mentions greeley a couple times - especially in regard to the number of cows it slaughters per hour and how the increase in numbe rof cows.. has increased the likelyhood for beef contamination. weird huh. something like that woudl never happen. <br/><br/>and in a shocking move, the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/020719/1/30opw.html">world's poorest nations lash out at richest</a>. Nobody expected that! but like always.. our esteemed military is<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/state_wire/story/3622286p-4648190c.html">practicing</a> to fight "evil" countries such as that.. luckly for us.
