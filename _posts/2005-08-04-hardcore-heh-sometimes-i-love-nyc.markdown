Last night after i interupted mark, tommie and their manager jim with a bunch of hifi equipment we decided to go to a barbeque hosted by lenny dee of hardcore techno fame. hah. It ruled. Everyone at the BBQ was from back in the day. It was like the gabbers greatest hits bbq.  so hilarious.  and awesome. i met <a href="http://www.ralphiedee.com/">ralphie dee</a>,  <a href="http://www.intuitivemusic.com/tguideadamx.html">adam x</a>, rob gee and a bunch of others. so funny.  i immediately came home and listened to my one remaining gabber cd.
