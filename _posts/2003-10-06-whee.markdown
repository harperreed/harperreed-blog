so everyday for the past couple days I have been meaning to update my site. but I keep getting interupted or cool stuff happens and I am like ahh.. "later."<br/><br/>soo.. on thursday my friends and I went to <a href="http://www.brujeria.com/">brujeria</a> at the aragon. it was incredible. the concert was apparently a mexican death metal festival - so there were a lot of bands. we got there at like 7 and the <a href="http://www.brujeria.com/">brujeria</a> didn;t start until 12. I was tired. but the show was soo awesome. <a href="http://www.brujeria.com/">brujeria</a> has a "hit" song called "<a href="http://www.lyrics.net.ua/song/9770">matando gueros</a>" which in english means "kill whitey." heh. it was pretty strange. but the band is so good. so it didn't matter. <Br><br/>Mike left on friday. it was pretty fun to have him around. on friday hiromi an I hung out and went to a phillip glass show <a href="http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/">koyaanisqatsi</a> at the chicago theatre. it was quite nice. kinda silly.. that minimalist crap is silly. but I liked it. and then we went to a middled eastern resturant called <a href="http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Bars-!PlaceDetail-7357,00.html">souk</a>. it ruled. there was a belly dancer and a live band.. and rather good food. it was nice. I love good food. then we went to a couple parties. <br/><br/>on saturday I slept in and then went shopping.. I couldn't really find anything so I gave up and went home.. but I found hiromi on the way home and we hung out.. then.. last night <a href="http://www.therats.org">matiss</a>, lenore, <a href="http://www.markhayward.net">mark</a> and myself all went to my friend <a href="http://www.equulei.com/">james'</a> party. it was a funny party. we then went to the signature lounge and attempted to have dessert. heh. it didn't work out. cuz.. they stop serving dessert after 12. stupid signature lounge.. 
<br/><br/>ahhh.. now it is time to start another week. wheee..
