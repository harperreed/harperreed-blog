<a href="http://www.cybermonkey.jp/html/game/swron/">This</a> game rules. It is the tron cars. So so fun. what a great <u>lunchtime</u> game ;). I should probably get that movie t some time. <br/><br/>so I got a new plugin for winamp that tracks what you listen to and then analyzes it and creates a "good" playlist for you that fits your music taste. however, it has to be trained. and I don't want to train it. so I am training it by listening to music. so in a ocuple weeks we shall see how it goes. I need to forget about it and just go through my normal listening pattern - but it is so hard ;) I want it to work now now now.
