I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
<br/><br/>the U.S. has proven what a dumb ass country we are:<br/>"<I>The Pledge, as currently codified, is an impermissible government endorsement of religion because it sends a message to unbelievers that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.</i>"<br/>
This seemingly obvious statement was made by the 9th circuit supreme and is being fiercely attacked by religious, ignorant and conservative people all over the US. It seems to me, that the separation of church and state is somewhat needed. Especially in this era. We, the US, are too diverse to pledge allegiance to one god.

Bush said the ruling was "out of step with the history and traditions of America," and said it highlighted the need for "common sense judges that understand that our rights are derived from God." <br/>heh. he is kinda dumb. It is funny that this is such a big deal when it was added less than 50 years ago. It hasn't been apart of our "tradition" very long. I also find it funny that ALL of our leaders our christian. Of course they wouldn't have a problem with this.
