today I get to go home. unfortunantly tomarrow I have to go back to work. it was quite nice not working - but all things must end and back to work I go. I will strangely be coming right back to chicago come friday. whee. this time hiromi will be coming so that should be fun. <Br><br/>my father is <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071429421-t610(4).jpg">out of the hospital</a> as of this afternoon. that is nice and refreshing. I am sure he is super happy to be back home - able to shower in his shower, sleep in his bed, eat his food.. etc etc. we are all very happy that it turned out well. <br/><br/>i am tired. I stayed up until 6:00 last night working on stuff for the <a href="http://www.saveamerica.nl">save america</a> people. it isn't done yet. but soon. I just have to budget my time better. I didn't do very well these past couple days. but I guess that makes since.. as I was busy with family stuff.. and such ;)
<BR><br/>last night I picked up the alien box set.. something quadrology -heh. it rules. there are NINE dvds. it extends like 7 ft or something. I am happy. so with that, pirates of the carribean and the new LOTR: return of the king - this week is gunna rule the movies. <br/><br/>i have to go and shower, pack, clean, run errands for my folks.. then I gotta drive my truck (hahaha I have a truck) to the airport and fly to chicago. wheee...
