So washington is <a href="http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?sid=44468&nid=25">prepared</a>. I would be so surprised if we were to receive a air strike. could you imagine what would happen. beside the fear and trauma that would occur. I mean every aspect of our life would be  affected. It would be insane. I am not ready fo that. I am ready for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62869-2003Feb12.html">this</a> however. wow. that could really change the dynamics of our foreign policy. maybe bush's missile shield should be a priority. hah. umm. that is a joke.. yea.. a joke... speaking of jokes.. <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=127&e=7&u=/030211/7/38rtp.html">here</a> is a little piece about my life. I hate student loans. they are one of my only burdens. my life would RULE if it wasn't for these bain. the author of that piece makes a good point about the IRAQ war. If we targeted educatoin rather than monopolizing the WORLD with our drivel - we may be able to save future generations from the same fate that has befallin myself. <br/>It is very interesting to how different organizations <a href="http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1329">leech off of certain events</a> in our strange world. In that case - clearchannel is preparing for war. but not in ways a normal person would expect. they are planning to engage the public to gain <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59829-2003Feb11.html">ratings</a>. heh. I love capitalism. I mean seriously. I love it.<br/>There is an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61347-2003Feb12.html">imminent terror threat</a>. Maybe if we didn't react like such "woosies" when we are attacked - terrorism wouldn't work against us. but <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">certain</a> <a href="http://www.gwbush.com">people</a> are "cowboys" and react in a very very stupid way. check out how reilly <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/Glick_56.wmv">reacts</a>. These are the people who are running our country. completely unable to learn and listen from others. unable to communicate. only able to strike. <a href="http://nata2.info/humor/bush/our_leader.gif">only able to kill</a>. and only if there is a buck to be made in the end. <br/>i think my favorite part about bush is how his economic plan and how he is alienating all of the people in the US except his rich friends. I read a figure where 97% of the american people will not save more than $1000 from his tax cuts per year. $1000/year is not much for a family with children. a family who is not very wealthy. Check out the back page of the most recent new yorker. it explains it.<br/><br/>oh.. for those of you who watched the jacko special. check <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/my_name_is_blanket.html">this</a> out.<br/>
<br/>last night I stayed out way to long. I did the same on monday night. hopefully tonight I will stay out not so late. 
or maybe just relax. jesus I am tired. I also recently discoverd the magic of the div tag. wtf. why didn't I know of this before. always playing with tables and all that. I am dumb.
