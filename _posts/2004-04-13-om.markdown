i am desprately tired. and possibly amid a financial crisis. <br/>in other news. my company seems pretty serious about sending me to india. it would be quite fun. I woudl be helping with dev. of our new secrets. fun fun. I woudl apparently leave in a couple(6) weeks and stay for god knows how long. I really have no idea. a week or 4 maybe? hmm weird. <br/><br/>i am doing ok. it is better today. but not really. just different. I am more involved in not thinking about it. I still hate it ;) but whatever. yea. umm. uh huh. 
<br/><br/>yea. I still need a hug. ok. <br/>i need sleep to.
