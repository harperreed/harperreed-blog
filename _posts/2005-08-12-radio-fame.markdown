I am once again awesome. 

Man i haven't had a chance to sit. running around and being crazy. its fun. but i am quite tired. 

Tomorrow i fly back to chicago for a VOX event - then i am back to working on sunday. Eep.

I got a PSP last night. it is cool. however it was already upgraded to 1.51 when i got it so none of the hacks work. :-(  

I got sunburned again. i hate the sun. i was so careful. then today for some reason i wasn't. eep.
