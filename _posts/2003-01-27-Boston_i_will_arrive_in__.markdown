Tomorrow I will arrive in boston for search engine training. I am excited but rather bummed that I will be going. I don't really want to leave chicago.. my friend <a href="http://www.mimiblume.com">miriam</a> is leavign for cologne on sunday and I would like time to spend with her before she leaves.. alas.. I guess I will have to wait and spend time later.. but that is why it sucks.. cuz later she will be in germany. suxor. stupid countries and such. <br/><br/>well luckily our president is going to take of the fact that other <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/25/1042911596206.html">countries are dumb</a>.<br/><br/>i am tired. I need to pack. I want to sleep.. but instead I must manage personal electronic devices ;).. hehe..
