Apparently it has become insane outside. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020817-704732.htm">nasa</a> is planning on reading people minds.. what.. wtf.. what.. no sense.. 
<br/>
A senetor is questioning the lack of <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/news/ns/story.jsp?floc=FF-PLS-PLS&amp;id=404800070&amp;dt=20020816183900&amp;w=APO&amp;coview=">enron indictments.. </a> no.. I hope bush doesn't get mad an shoot him .. in texas style.. <br/>
<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=518&amp;u=/ap/20020817/ap_on_re_eu/russia_iraq_9&amp;printer=1">iraq and russia signed or are goign to sign a deal</a>.. I wonder if this will lead to WW3.. hopefully.. <br/>weeeeeeeeeeeeee<br/>
but if WW3 starts.. I am sure the <a href="http://tampatrib.com/nationworldnews/MGALJ9Y5W4D.html">plans would be leaked</a> to the press so that we woudl all know what is going on. <br/><br/>
dayum.. our world is ending... if I was a christian.. I would be scared of apocalypse.. but since I am not.. I am scared of eternal night. ;)
