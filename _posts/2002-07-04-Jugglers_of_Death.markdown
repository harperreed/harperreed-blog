I sit in my kitchen once again.. having just got back from a juggling show at the <a href="http://www.prodigalsonbar.com">Prodigal Son</a>. It was a great time. It was incredible. The audience was receptive.. the juggling went well. We didn't drop at any pivitol points.. heh. and we got contacts for more gigs. <br/><br/>I am very interested in what is going to happen in the marrow. I wonder if the "<a href="http://www.georgebush.com/">terrorists</a>" will attack. I hope not, however it would be interesting to see what plans are foiled. Hopefully we don't get punished for our sins. heh. wierd that we are at war with terror.
