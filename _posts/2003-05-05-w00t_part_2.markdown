saturday night we went to this resturant called <a href="http://www.masrestaurant.com/masrestaurant/">mas</a> where we were meeting some friends. As soon as we arrived this guy started talkign to us and eventually purchased each of us (<a href="http://thom.watership.org">Thom</a>, <a href="http://chris.fm/">Chris</a> and <a href="http://www.harperreed.org">myself</a>) many MAS MARGARITA then some MOJITO and finally some CAIPIRINHA this was also accompanied by a shot of tequila and sprite. It was great. He was a really nice guy. so so funny. The rest of our guests arrived so we got a table and sat down.  We had appetizers and entrees and some drinks.. THen when we were done the waitress brought our check and let us know that our previous benefactor had purchased our meals and our appetizers. so our check for this $200 dinner was $22. It ruled.
