i am about to start my new <a href="http://www.skinnycorp.com">job</a>. Like i need to write down the address and arrive - and magically i will be employed. You can't imagine how excited i am. being unemployed has been rough on my life. i like not doing stuff. but i miss having excess brain time to do <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org/ag/flickr">hacks</a> and other crap. 

this summer has been interesting. i think i am at a point where i can talk about it. not emotionally or anything - but the nda's are almost void. hah. 

i am hungry. and rather tired.
