<br/><br/>i am going to add a del.icio.us plugin to my site soon. it should rule. then you all can see what I am lookign at. today for instance.. I looked at this amazing website about <a href="http://www.cowboybooks.com.au/html/acidtrip1.html">this guy who made drawings while tripping on acid</a>. it is incredible. experiments like this make me smile. I enjoy smiling. seriously. oh oh oh my <a href="http://www.colepierce.com">friend coles</a. site made me smile. 

<br/><br/>
i love <a href="http://www.a500hacking.com">a500hacking.com</a>. because of this wonderful site I got constantly get emails drom people I don't konw about cell phone stuff. usually they don't really say anything and often they are kinda funny to read.. I usually don't respond. but I felt the need today. here is a legit email I responded to:
