So we shall see how it goes. My plan is to make it welcome me when i arrive and to control LEDs to alert me of certain things. It will have Bluetooth, Audio and CF based wifi. I am pretty excited. I feel it will relaly push my skillz to the max. hah.

I have an incredible growth in my nose. i think it is snot. It may just be a zit inside my nose. it hurts. Hopefully it will go away. if it won't maybe i will visit jeffrey's dermatoligist and get that shit lanced. haha.

We are going to start blogging about work. I am pretty excited. Hopefully it will be less random and ranty than this one. or wait. whatever. i need to sleep a minute to collect my thoughts. then rock it.
