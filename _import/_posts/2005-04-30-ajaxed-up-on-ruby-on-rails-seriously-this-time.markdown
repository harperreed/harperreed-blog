So i haven't really been posting to my blog as i would like. I have instead been coding <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">ruby on rails </a>applications. it is fun. i am kinda bored. sorta. not really. i was bored. then i discovered the ajax helpers. haha.  so much fun. unfortunately a site such as <a href="http://harperreed.org">harperreed.org</a> doesn't lend itself to being ajax'd. I was able to do some fanciness with the <a href="http://harperreed.org/quotations/random">quotation on the front </a>and the <a href="http://harperreed.org/contact">contact form</a>.  check it out. i am proud. 

<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">ajax</a>. this is an interesting topic. i noticed that everyone who is anyone is thinking about it (and if you aren't - you should be). I really think it does change how the user perceives a web application. especially when the entire webapp is ajax'd. it makes it a seamless user experience (which is apparently the key). i am happy about this. I feel that most of the web apps i have been involved with haven't been horrible - however they all show some signs of being user-unfriendly.  ajax would lend some capabilities to our developer toolbelts that allows us to include some fanciness and "seamlessness" to the otherwise boring and annoying webapps. 

Bruce Springsteen is amazing. 

I am currently working on: <a href="http://ituners.com">ituners.com</a>, <a href="http://howtoyoyo.com">howtoyoyo.com</a>, <a href="http://jokesareawesome.com">jokesareawesome.com</a>, <a href="http://weatherisaewsome.com ">weatherisaewsome.com</a> and <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org ">blogs.nata2.org</a> in ruby on rails - with ajax where i need it. I am most excited right now for ituners.com and howtoyoyo.com. i think that howtoyoyo offers a great opportunity to create a rather compelling application that is very user friendly(since the age we are targeting is around 14-20). i am excited to make common forms (user sign-up, private messages, video uploading) into ajax action. it will be so smoooooth.  the video uploading is gunna be so dope.  i am trying to think how to make it super super smooth. cuz i DO NOT want to just do ajax for the hell of it.  whatever. i need to sleep or something to stop thinking about ajax and ruby on rails. 

my friends who hear me talking about <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">ruby on rails</a> have started to refer to it as raspberry. heh. rule. 

so tonight i went to the apple store and purchased tiger. i am disappointed. wtf happened to native support for my phone. wtf should i have to download a "helper" application to sync with. it seems that they probably didn't write in support for the native syncml that the 7610 supports - they probably just wanted to write a quick fix. stupid apple. 

And then dashboard - why doesn't that shit hover on my desktop. i mean. its cool. but i hate pressing F13 or whatever to see the "widgets" 

I decided that i need a powerbook. it will allow me to do development and be cool. like the cool kids. but what will i do my c# stuff in? sad day. 

i also got a <a href="http://www.jackspade.com/greenest/messenger09/index.html">bag</a> today. it was far too expensive. but i felt i needed something fancy to make up for all the non-fanciness that is my life. really i could have just got a pair of pants. that would have been a better idea. what world is it where i don't even blink when buying a tie for 100,  a bag for 150 or a pair of jeans for 200. i need another suit and i expect to pay 1000 for it - i guess.. lame. 

i am tired. i need a new cell phone. ;) and i need to spell check my portfolio. 

I HATE MEAT LOAF - so goddamn bad
