i enjoy work. it is fun. the people are nice. i am excited to get relaly involved and spend days and nights here. haha. 

i <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F250820050948&img=Nokia7610%28333%29.jpg">have</a> a lot of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F250820051114&img=Nokia7610%28334%29.jpg">monitor</a> at my desk. a combined amount of 47inches. w00t. the best is the little 7" lilliput display. totally for irc and by irc i mean work. The office is real nice.  it is real real open and everything is pretty cool. i am so far happy here.

and i am tired. i relaly need a nap. and reading of a book. and hanging out. 

although i miss hiromi - it seems she is getting more acclimated to japan. it is nice to talk with her on aim though. i can't wait until a google talk client comes for mac. which reminds me. i need another monitor to put blood on.
