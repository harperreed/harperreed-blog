So on Thursday night - I accidentally went and bought some clothes. It was ridiculous. I should never be allowed in to certain far too expensive stores. However I got a hot pair of pants.. not a pair of hot pants mind you.. but yea. So I gotta return some stuff and keep some stuff. I really can?t deal with pants without belt loops ? I just feel insane when I am not wearing a belt. Heh. Yea about that. So then Friday happened. I hung out with chris and we rolled to a <a href="http://www.chicagothong.org/ ">party</a>. it was quite <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20018.jpg">insane</a>. but <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20010.jpg">chris and I fit in</a>. morgan however was not party to our <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20014.jpg">raindeer games</a>. basically it was a political party that was organized by these crazed <a href="http://www.chicagothong.org/ ">chicago thong people</a>. I coudln't quite figure out what their deal was - but they were against genetically modified food for sure. chris and I wore these crazy rabbit fur jocks and capes. it ruled. however I hope I never run for <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20002.jpg">president</a> I will be totally <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20015.jpg">screwed</a>.<br/>After that party we dropped morgan off and rolled to vision. Previously in the day I had received <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1075505796-t610(1).jpg">my rabbit fur coat</a> in the mail from an ebay auction. it cost me 12 dollars(with $7 dollars shipping) and turned out to be pretty good quality. so I decided to wear this jacket in vision. I was rolling like a pimp. p I m p. oh yea. it was brocks bday at vision and everyone was en force. it was fun. however I don't suggest not wearing pants in a club. it is quite daunting. I guess that is why pants are often required for club entrance. hmm.. after vision we made it to crobar. I have no idea how this happened. haha. I didn't plan on going to crobar at all. but it was a good time and I was happy to see a lot of my friends ;)

It was a great night. was had soem really <a href="http://www.patrontequila.com/patron2.html">great tequila</a> and <a href="http://www.millerbrewing.com/home.asp">poor beer</a>.
<br/><br/>often on mondays and lunch times - my server gets pounded like a alterboy and it crashes everything. it sucks because my heart stops for the moments it isn't up. if it breaks.. I gotta figure out how to make it not break. hah. I guess I gotta deliever my dells. dayum. ok.
