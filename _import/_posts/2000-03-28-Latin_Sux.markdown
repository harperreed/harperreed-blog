title: Latin Sux
excerpt: |
  I start school again. I am not as excited as i should be, cuz i got latin. I hate latin. Its too hard to be fun. i wish it were like "really advanced generic computer science that is too hard for everyone" becuase than i would have a chance to have fun. But nope... the final latin class calls my name. I also need to finish my symposium project.
