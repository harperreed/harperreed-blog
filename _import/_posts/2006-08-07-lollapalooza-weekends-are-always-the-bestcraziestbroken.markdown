I am very tired today.

The last 3 days have been full of crazy parties and fun people.  On thursday was the kill hannah party at crobar. It ruled. Then on friday was Dark Wave Disco - with lady SOV and Tommie Sunshine. After that was the party with the motherfucker peeps and the virgin tears. Then of course.. the afterpary. it was pretty much the same thing as before. haha. CobraSnake was there and i <a href="http://thecobrasnake.com/partyphotos/chichgoice/IMG_8064.html">gots</a> <a href="http://thecobrasnake.com/partyphotos/chichgoice/IMG_8164.html">some pictures taken</a>. yea know. the same shit. It was pretty fun. Then on saturday we went to the kanye party at the Hard Rock Hotel, then we went to crobar.

I am burned out.
