Well, i am off to colorado in two days. My parents will be having an anniversary party(they have been married 27 years). It should be fun. Kinnera i going with me. I am rather excited. The drive will be hell - but whatever. <br> on a completly different note. I am almost completly done with the scripts and tools that manage nata2.com. it rules. I can update a billing session with one click and print invoice(all 25 of them!!) in one click. It is so cool. Soon i will add the interest calculator and such. weeee. so fun.
