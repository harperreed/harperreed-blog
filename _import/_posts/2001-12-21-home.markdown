excerpt: I am going home from work on my christmas break. Boy, if I only knew what christmas break was like when I "grew up", I wouldn't have petereed away all my breaks when I was in school. I have a whole big 4 days. It is barely enough time to do anything. and to top it all off.. all my friends are disposed of, or away. alas.. I guess I will goto lord of the rings by myself. how sad..
