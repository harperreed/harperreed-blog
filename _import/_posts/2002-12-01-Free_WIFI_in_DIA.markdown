SO I take out my laptop to check my email using my phone.. and I for kicks turn on the wifi card to sniff around.. and much to my surprise I get a excellent wifi signal. so I type a web address and I get authenticated through att wireless "free" wifi service in airports. RULE. now it is time to look at some pron. haha. anyway.. I will be back to chitown soon.. I had a really good time in greeley though.. we went to this really silly country western bar that played three songs of country and three songs of pop alternatly. It was so funny. I laughed a lot. We danced and danced. It is nice. I am excited however to have the big city surrounding me. I like cities.
