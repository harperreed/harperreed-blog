I am really sick. it sucks quite a bit. I have a sore throat, achy bones, tired joints, sinus headache, and I can't eat. sad day. I have been in bed all day and I was in bed al yesterday. it sucks. not a good scene at all. especially since I am unable to take a sick day/days at work. no good at all. anyway.. <br/><br/>so on friday I went to a party but went home cuz I was ill - yesterday I went to hang out with kelly perry. it was fun to see her. a nice time.
