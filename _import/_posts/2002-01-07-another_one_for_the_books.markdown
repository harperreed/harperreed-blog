i need to post a link.. since I was doing so well awhile ago and now I am doing poorly.. so here goes:<br/><br/>
OK, so I play a game called <a href="http://www.astraware.com/palm/bejeweled/">bejeweled</a> on my palm pilot to and from work everyday. My father got a score of 99940 and we were all very impressed.. except my girlfriend who took it like a personal challenge to beat my father into submission.. so she played and played and played.. and finally 107550. she did it.. but I was a dumb-ass and put my name instead of hers.. so now she will have to take another three hours and do it again.. hehe.. <br/>so anyway I found the original game. It is called diamond mind and is available <a href="http://www.popcap.com/">here</a>. So check it out and see what caused my family to develop nervous twitches...
