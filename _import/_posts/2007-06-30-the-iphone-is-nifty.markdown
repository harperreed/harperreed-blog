<p>Yesterday my friend Bryce was in town for the FBLA national meet. Pretty cool. We walked all over Chicago and I made sure we swung by the Apple store to check out the iPhone. Pretty nifty. I don't know if it is a replacement for a smartphone - but it certainly is swell. The maps and text application are both really nice. I like the text app better than the treo. Both blow the defaults on the S60 devices out of the water. </p> <p>If it were available for t-mobile&nbsp;I imagine I would get one. I think they are perfect for people who need an iPod and a phone - but don't have strict requirements for either. I think it would be great for my mom. </p> <p>I wonder how the battery life will be. Especially when someone ends up listening to it extensively. &nbsp;</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:88831816-754a-4c02-812c-1e36c45e1f64" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]iphone, apple, phones[/tags]</div>
