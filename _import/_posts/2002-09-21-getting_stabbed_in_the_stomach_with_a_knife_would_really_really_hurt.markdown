I am sitting here watching this movie.. writing on my weblog.. chillin.. chekcin email.. now if all this were built into <a href="http://www.a500hacking.com">my phone</a> I would be happy. real real happy. so happy I think I would probably go out more. heh. lies all lies.. the real reason I started this entry was for <A href="http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s682222.htm">this</a>.
