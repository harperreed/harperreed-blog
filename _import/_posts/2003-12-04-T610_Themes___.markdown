So I made a bunch of themes last nigth waiting for my laundry to get done. you can find them <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/t610%20themes">here</a>. This phone is fun and dope ;)<br/>here are some <a href="http://www.esato.com/board/viewtopic.php?topic=44482&forum=29">posts</a> about my themes.<br/><br/>so I get home at 5:30 - tired. annoying.. wanting somethign fun to happen. I gather my laundry and take it downstairs - only to find someone has taken up both the dryer and the washer.. no problem.. I can wait. so I leave my laundry and wait an hour. 6:30 comes both machines are stopped.. the person doesn't get their stuff... 7:30 still there.. I go to dinner with morgan.. come back at 9ish - still there.. 9:15 I see someone manipulating the dryer.. come back in ten minutes put my laundry in the washer. it gets done before ten. the dryer is done around 10:30. 11:30 - nobody has empied the dryer, 12:30 same. so I emptied it with a note. hopefully the person will understand. I have to sleep.. jesus I am tired.
