I have to control this. heh. morgan called at like 7:30 and was like.. "hey why don't you meet me at my work at 9:30." I was late. haha. I slept through a 9:30pm appointment. hahah. seriously. <br/><br/>so anywy. tonight was relaly fun. I hungout with morgan at hollywood grill. we just screwed around. talked shit. yea know.. the usual. I beat her at thumb wrestling. we had diner food. it ruled. <br/>we then helled about wicker park - in an attempt at finding coffee beans after 12. no luck. nothing is open but hot dog stands and bars after 12. we should have known. <br/>her room is starting to look like a real place. no longer is it just a figment of my imaginatino. heh. the color is quite something. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/campaignjournal?pid=1429">this</a> is quite something. <br/><br/>i have a secret project. hopefully it will rule. wait. I have two. haha. one is funnier. the other is <a href="http://www.scottv.org">pretty cool too</a>.
