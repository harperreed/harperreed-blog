Soo.. I just wrote this entry and I clicked on a really fucked up link and broke it. heh. it was funny. it was also pornographic and I was also at work.. all on accident. .hehe. whoa.. I had to kill explorer.. stupid explorer. ;)<br/><br/>I am currently listening to tusk.. which is quite loud and angry. for some reason I am rather in to it right now.. I really wanted to listen to elliot smith.. but it didn't work out hehe. <br/><br/>I want to get back into the politik fashion thing.. I think that this emo/nerd/indie rock fashion thing that is happening is boring compared to ultra-politik fashion. heh. but what would happen to my diesel then.. ;)<br/><blockquote><small>

<br/>It is interesting how the U.S. reacted to one of its leading senators being <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42859-2002Dec11.html">racist</a>..

i am rather happy about current events regarding my life.. the world as we know it is <a href="http://monroe.lib.mi.us/mcemd/civdef.htm">calming</a>.. I am reading the biography of Ludwig Wittgenstein. he is insane. a crazy man. I think he is my most favorite philosopher. I am bad at writing.
