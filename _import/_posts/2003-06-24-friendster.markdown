So while friendster is sucking it up.. cacheing everything.. and taking a long time for shit to work.. I did some research. <a href="http://www.jabrams.com/">this</a> guy started it.. he has apparently <a href="http://www.jabrams.com/bio.html">been around</a> for awhile. check out the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=friendster.com">growth</a>. it is obvious that they did not prepare for this amount of traffic. <br/><br/>on another note.. did anyone notice that <a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a> is slowly purchasing everything. weird.<br/><br/>my mouth tastes funny.. stupid antifreeze.. so sweet.. yet such a bad aftertaste
