It was amazing. One of the craziest and coolest things i have done. I wasn't expecting the number of people - nor the feelings and emotions that were around. It was pretty cool.

It started monday morning when i called charlie and was like "you in - word. i am in." He showed up and we went to the division and ashland intersection. There was the nearest meetup to start the parade. We then walked with everyone to union park. and hung out for awhile. and from there we walked down randolph and then another street. Hah.

Sadly we had to go around 1pm so we had to split once we reached  michigan.

I took a movie and will be posting it after the jump. Check it out. I have posted all my pictures on flickr. Check them out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594122367015/">here</a>.
