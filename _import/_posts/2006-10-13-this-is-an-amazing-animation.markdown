<p>I love the internet. It is the mecca of weird awesome stuff. This totally fits under wierd and awesome. And the animation is top class. Quite nice. </p> <p>From the <a href="http://www.motionographer.com/2006/10/10/jewels-ink-and-feathers/">Motion Graphics agency blog</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>This really interesting short film caught my eye the other day. It received the animation award at the <a href="http://www.rushes.co.uk/sohoshorts/">Rushes Soho Shorts Festival</a>. There are some pretty great moments in this piece, a good story, really interesting animation, and a great use of 2.5d space. The short was created by <a href="http://www.runwrake.com/">Run Wrake</a>, an animator and illustrator, who’s been in the game since 1990, nice. Congrats Run!</p></blockquote> <p><a href="http://motionographer.com/media/idol.mov">Check it out</a>. </p> <p>So nice and creepy. And I love jewels, ink and feathers. and as Dylan says "Greed Rocks."</p>
