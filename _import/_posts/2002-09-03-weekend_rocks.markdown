This weekend I worked. I ended a 14 day streak of working 8 hours or more a day. it was rough. but I finally had a one day vacation. suxor. my projet goes live tomarrow. I am gettign sick. I need caffiene. I need to learn how to spell. I got a new <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp">phone</a>.. 3G.. in da house. it is cool. color and all. I am going to start writing simple applications for it to catch myself up on the J2ME stuff. heh. what a nerd I am ey..<br/>
whatever<br/>
Ohh Ooh.. pick me pick me.. <br/>
so bush is set to address our nation on sept 11. whoa.. that dude is so dumb. check out <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=interior31&amp;date=20020831&amp;query=Ecosystem">who he picked to fight our forest fires</a>.. and apparently bush is going to meet with <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20020903/ts_nm/iraq_usa_meeting_dc_4&amp;printer=1">congressional leaders about iraq</a>. right. I hope they have the sense enough to distance themselve from this war monger. <br/><br/>i hope we don't start a nuclear war. then I woudl lose my recently acquired 3G phone service.. without ever seeing the potential that is there .. haha
