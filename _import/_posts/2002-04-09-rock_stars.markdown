so I went and saw the faint.. it was great. they were good a little bit canned. however I saw one of my friends who let me in on the secret of the "indie rock undrworld" a little joint called <a href="http://www.luc.edu/orgs/undergroundchitown/dining/watusi.html">watusi</a>.. where even I can pass as a suceeding or not suceeding musician.. underground or whatnot. heh. "when I released my record in englan..." - "i loved that show.. I saw them a long time ago.." - "oh, maiden.. I have their dvd.." <br/> I am no better.. but at least I act like myself.. rather then what I feel someone to act.. I also scored a "date." well not really a date.. only a date because all days have them.. for a concert.. on thrusday.. she is really cool.. and she digs cannibal corpse.. ha.
