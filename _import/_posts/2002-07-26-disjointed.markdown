Today has been weird. I am almost done with my encyclopedia. like pretty much finished. so I am in a rut.. trying top find all of the little things to do.. and to clean up. I am excited to see how it does.. but I spent a small amount of time looking at some links I found.. <br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.rathergood.com/mark/">britPOP</a> fans unite. this is a very very strange flash movie. derigerbil!!!. <a href="http://mohsye.com/games/breeder.swf">here</a> is a good flash game.. you have to breed bunnies. Once when I was in high school my friend <a href="http://www.in5anity.org">jon</a> and I started experimenting with potato guns. we made all sorts of designs. This was before any crazed fool would make a <a href="http://216.25.100.182/detail.asp?id=26">website</a> giving help, plans and kits out. It is nuts.. we used to break so much stuff with them. heh. The website is good, and it has a funny quote about one of the guns they <a href="http://216.25.100.182/detail.asp?id=23">designed for the air force</a>: <blockquote>"<i>The Army spec was that it be powerful enough for a tennis ball to dent 25 mil (0.025") aluminum sheet from 20 feet away. At 100 psi it will probably send a ball THROUGH 1/4" plate.... I fired one ball out of it down into a swimming pool; the ball bounced off the water and went a few blocks in the air before I lost sight of it!</i>"</blockquote> hehe. <br/><br/><a href="http://blog.hotornot.com/">this</a> isn't as fun as the pretty girls ones.. but it is still funny and it peaks my voyeuristic tendencies. here is a <a href="http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000004/images/2002/07/24/bomb-1.jpg">funny picture</a>. I think <a href="http://onyx.malagraphixia.com/H&K_MP5/H&K_MP5.htm">this</a> is a lego machine gun
When I grow up I want <a href="http://www.lesters.com/titanic.htm">this</a> slide in my backyard.
maybe then my <a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/pee/bun.html">cats</a> will come back. you can <a href="http://subintsoc.net/madlib.php">make your very own</a> terror press release.
<br/>see if you can <a href="http://www.dogbomb.co.uk/display.php?page=waldo">find waldo</a>!!
