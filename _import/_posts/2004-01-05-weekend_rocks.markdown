This weekend was fun. besides having the craziest of sleep patterns I was able to hang with some away cool cats. first on friday I hung out with morgan. we went and got dinnera nd then came back to my place and drank and talked with matiss and hiromi. we ended up watchin a korean remake of ringu called the ring virus. it was ok. not wonderful. I should have pushed for fun sai yuk. but nooooo... ;) then on saturday I slept until 6. it is madness. no matter when I go to bed I am seemingly able to sleep ALL day. I don't really think this will work out well with my work schedule ;). on saturday I woke up at 6 and matiss hiromi and I hung out and watched something. I don't remember what.. then we went to the duke of perth and had excellent fish and chips. it ruled. on our way home we stopped at barnes and nobles and looked at books.  I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765308835/nata2productions">the peace war</a> by Vernor Vinge - which I ended up reading last night. it was good. I am such a sucker for science fiction. haha. I also got a couple of philip k dick books as well. I enjoy him. I like reading about alternative realities. <br/><br/>time for <a href="http://www.acapulcotans.com/image/about-bed.jpg">bed</a>. hopefully I will get up at an appropriate time. :)
