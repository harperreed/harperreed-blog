well maybe not quite that extreme - but a bunch of cool/fun things happened today. first I was attacked on a <a href="http://pub72.ezboard.com/fnycjugglingfrm4.showMessage?topicID=384.topic">juggling</a> b board about my rattail - so I defended... a bit unsuccessfully - but I tried. then I am going to be helping with a secret project. which is going to rule. <br/><br/>last night I yoyoed a bunch with mark.. and then hung out with morgan. it is nice to hang with morgan.. that is bit unexpected. but I am enjoying it altogether. and apparently my new name is futureman which is an incredible name. <br/>tonight I am going to dinner with kinnera and I finally get that damn belt back. stupid rockers stealing my stuff. ok. this is a pretty topicless nonsensical rant of a post - I will stop now.
