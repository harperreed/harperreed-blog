so i have been working on wordpress and i decided to upgrade all my friends to wordpress. so i did <a href="http://www.proxientunit.com">mike's</a>, <a href="http://www.mimiblume.com" title="miriams">miriams</a>, <a href="http://www.dylanreed.org" title="Dylan's">Dylan's</a>, <a href="http://www.danielleclock.org/blog/">danielles</a> and <A href="http://www.mikecompton.com/blog/">comptons</a> and soon i will get Matiss's and Thom's. 

hopefully this will rule - we could have a huge trackback club. and more people will se our blogs. MORE MORE MORE. then i will have to make <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org">blogs.nata2.org</a> fancy. i imagine i will attempt to use javascript and ajax to make it rule. making a comment subsystem. but more importantly - a way to load up each users who rss feed under their entry. i love the Internet. if i only had about 12 more hours in my day ;)

so. i am thinking of writing a <a href="http://www.phpmvc.net/">PHP, MVC</a>, <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">SMARTY</a> (maybe with XSL, XML) cms. just something real real real simple. something that could power anything from <a href="http://www.weownthesun.com">weownthesun</a> to <a href="http://www.filaphilia.com">filaphilia</a> to <a href="http://www.tommiesunshine.org">tommiesunshine.org</a>. just something awesome. awesome and simple. i am tired of using <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">played out blog software</a> to power my sites. i need something that will generate pages - be easy to expand and will make design simple as hell. i think with the proper motivation this could also be commercially viable. w00t. don;t get me wrong however. i really like <a href="http://www.mamboforge.com">mambo</a>. however. it is too big for a lot of sites and i don't want unnecessary complications.
