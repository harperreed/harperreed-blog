My friend jacob got a Nokia 3250 on my recommendation and was disappointed that it didn't have as many apps as my N70 did. So while scouring the internet and looking for applications for him i decided that i would create an application list for the Symbian 3rd edition phones.
<div style="text-align: center"><!--adsense--></div>
Here it goes:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://nokia-3250-software.epocware.com/Handy_Weather.html">Handy Weather</a> -</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.s2.org/putty/">Putty</a> -</li>
</ul>
If you have found software that is hopefully missing from this list. Please <a href="http://www.harperreed.org/contact">contact me</a> and let me know. .
