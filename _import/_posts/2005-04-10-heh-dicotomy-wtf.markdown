So i was chilling in phoenix and i called my dad. i told him that i wanted to make a website for my grandfather and that my mom and dad should start scanning pictures - or send them to me to scan. and my dad was like.. umm why don't you come out here and do it this weekend. he then offered to pay airfare ;) so i purchased some tickets and flew to Colorado. got in Friday. my mom was at some conference in Cheyenne so she wouldn't know i was here until she got home on Saturday. which left Friday night and Saturday day to my father and i's own devices. So we went and purchased a scanner and started ripping it up on the pictures. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Ffamily">i scanned about 200 pictures in</a>. it takes soooo long. it is rather annoying. 

so anyway. i found this old comic my dad made for me - so i took it and webified it and posted it to the internet. check it out: <a href="http://www.fastmilo.com">fast milo</a>. rule. 

Then on Sunday i woke up to a<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&img=colorado_radar_041005.jpg"> HUGE snowstorm</a>. all of Denver is closed. power is out all over the front range, United <a href="http://www.ua2go.com/flifo/FlightSummary.do?date=&deparr+value%3D=&time=&Check=&orig=&dest=&fs_type=Number&fltNbr=1458">stopped flying</a> until Tuesday and i am totally stranded. the next available flight is on Tuesday. sad sad day.  but whatever. more time here. 

so rather than go to the airport i got a bunch of stuff done on my grandfathers site: <a href="http://oldvd.org">oldvd.org</a>.

now on to world domination. 

i am gunna have to do laundry
