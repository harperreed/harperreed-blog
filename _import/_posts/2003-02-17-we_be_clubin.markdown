so <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20689-2003Feb17.html">a club broke</a> and <a href="http://www.nbc5.com/news/1981489/detail.html">many people died</a> last night. My parents called at 7:30 to make sure I was alive. 7:30. that is so early. anyway.. I can totally imagine that happening in many of the clubs I have been in. they all have ONE entrance or exit and it is usually very small and around a lot of stairs. Friday I went to REDNO5 and their was a slight scuffle on the landing of one of the staircases and some people fell... I couldn't imagine what would happen if everyone wanted to leave. I think the most screwed up part is that the cops react so violently - thinking that the people are ALWAYS wrong. I can imagine it easily - two cops arrive and see people streaming out - so to contain the situation they order everyone inside. wtf. why didn't they listen to the people.. well I guess they need to make sure they have a closed quarters for the "crime." but wasn't the crime having the rest of the doors locker? whatever. I wonder what the repercussions of this will be... Sometimes really <a href="http://www.sbsun.com/Stories/0,1413,208~12588~1181610,00.html">crazy things happen</a><br/><br/>i wonder how the protest went this weekend. I hope well. I really wanted people to take notice. I should have been their but I was sleeping.. hah... whoops.. I am totally against the war though.. I mean unless it gets in the way of my beauty sleep. which I need so badly - especially since I have replaced food and normal sleep with GTA vice city. <b>;)</b>
