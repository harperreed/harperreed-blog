This weekend was insane. as you may be able to tell from the crazy blog entries. I was a madperson. So.. on saturday I went to quad cities juggle fest. it was a lot of fun. I hung out with mark and some nice jugglers from carleton college. we juggled a bunch. I love juggling with little kids - who are as good as I am. hah. at five or so I went to the theatre with mark.. and hung out with the performers a bit. then <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20013.jpg">derek</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20012.jpg">kevin</a> came and we got dinner. after dinner was the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20014.jpg">show</a> which we watched. After the show we went to Mt. Vernon(where my <a href="http://www.cornellcollege.edu">alma mater</a> is) and hung out. I hung out with derek and his gf(who is really cool) and generally chilled out. While at the bar I ran into a really <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20017.jpg">old friend</a> who I hadn't really hung out with since 6th or 8th grade.  we all left the bar and helled about campus - drinking on tarr roof, hangin out in the dorms and <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/holidays/halloween_2003/halloween_crazy%20022.avi">just generally causing a ruckus</a>. it was fun. I then made my way back to derek's gfs house - where we were staying. I woke up at 11:30 or 12 and we headed back to the quad cities. I juggled a bit and yoyoed a bunch. mark and I headed out and I got back to chicago aruond 10.<Br><br/>at 10 I had a meeting for work. this is where the craziness started. my coworkers and I met from 10pm until 3:30am. at this time it was decided that I should go to the office and fix some shit. so I went to the office. I coudln't figure out how to turn the damn lights on( I finally figured it out). and I attempted to fix shit. so then I met with everyone from 8-2:30. I got home at 3 and crashed until 7:30am this morning. and that is where I am now. a bit weak from not eating.. but generally rested. <br/><br/>so in summary.. I worked 18hrs straight and then slept 17hrs. I rule. 

<br/><br/>I got my tivo last night.. so hopefully I will be playing with it tonight. I gotta <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=misc/misc_hacking&text=DTivo%20Hacking%20FAQ.txt">figure</a> it out though. <br/><br/>w00t
