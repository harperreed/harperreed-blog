i really need to upgrade servers. I need like 3 more. One for a firewall, one for web hosting and one for backups. That would rule. <br/>
i price them at around 4k. So if anyone wants to give me 4k. I would be happy ;)<br/><br/>So apparently <a href="http://audreyhacking.com">audreyhacking.com</a> is in <a href="http://wired.com">wired</a> this month. Somewhere around page 75. I really need to go and buy a copy. I will put some scans up. Some people are moving in or something downstairs and it is driving me up the wall. they are bummping around and thumping a lot. it is worse than music. it is so sporadic. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/21/nightclub.fire/">omfg</a>. hahah.. stupid great white. it is apparently not a good week to go to night clubs.<br/>stupid war. man the government is dumb - after popular culture has made fun of the pathetic movies made in the 40s and 50s about nuclear war - the government went ahead and <a href="http://ready.gov/">did it again</a>. this time it includes chemical warfare as well. I mean how stupid do they think we are. obviously rather stupid. wtf. Well not as stupid as the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/18/iraq/main537096.shtml">U.N. think the U.S. is</a>. I think it is interested to hear EVERYONE talk about <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2077874">how stupid the french</a> are for trying to speak out against the U.S. and our plans for war. Why don't we listen rather than say <a href="http://ehowa.com/pic/chiracpoem.jpg">they are dumb</a>. I mean really do we want all the countries of the world to act like the british and become puppets of bush. Cuz obvously bush knows what <a href="http://nata2.info/humor/bush/bushpick.mov">he is doing</a>. I mean.. I am totally excited for <a href="http://www.ki4u.com/nuclearsurvival/states/il.htm">world</a> <a href="http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.cfm?uc_full_date=20030220&uc_comic=db&uc_daction=X">war</a><br/><br/>I have been listening to isis a bunch lately. It is very good. I want to start a music review site. I think I coudl do a good job. it would be music and shows I think. maybe like <a href="http://www.riottech.net">riottech</a> but with a LOT more community. I have taken to capitalizing words that I want to emphasize. but I my typing looks like this:<br/>Hey WHAT is up. I am REALLY bored.<br/>and then I feel like such a <a href="http://nata2.info/humor/bush/badman.jpg">dork</a>.  <br/>If you haven't watched <a href="http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_hi.mpg">this</a>, do so now. Please.
