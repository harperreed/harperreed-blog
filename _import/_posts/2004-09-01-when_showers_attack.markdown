It was nuts. I about died. I couldn't possibly imagine what had happened. honestly scared the hell out of me. I really love being scared. <br/><br/>i leave for greality today. my brother is getting married on saturday. I am pretty excited. I hope to renew my license. then unrenew it. then get n illinois license. I suppose it is a good plan after a couple years. but whatever. <br/><br/>last night I went with <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(424).jpg">hirom</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(425).jpg">valentina</a> to an excellent <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(423).jpg">korean</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(422).jpg">bbq</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(426).jpg">place</a>. it was so good. <3. after dinner we went to this nice lounge called <a href="http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/43598,0,1932950.venue">orange</a>. we had some fresh pinapple soju. it was so good. then we stopped by juggling club. then I packed. and set up my laptop for doing development on the plane. haha. I love that when I travel I am like.. "hmm what shoudl I do - watch a dvd or write software?" - I am totally not a nerd. <br/><br/>i kind of want to sleep.
