<b>This is a rant:</b><br/>
I do not like that we are at war right now. I think it is really ridiculous. I mean, our enemy is a group of militants that we don?t officially know exists, they use weapons that are more powerful than what we use, they are scare mongered into <a href="http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2002/LAW/06/10/enemy.combatant/al.muhajir.jpg">inhuman</a> monsters. And it seems that <a href="http://www.gwbush.com">bush</a> has yet to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/06/10/mideast/index.html">acknowledge</a> that there is a problem in the middle east(in terms of U.S. foreign policy). We create a problem with imperialism.. Which in turn fuels another larger problem.. a religious problem with its basis in morality and ethics.. a problem mortals cannot solve. . and we choose to fight this problem by continueing our support for hate and imperialism.. thus stratifying the nations involved from a ?first world.? It is disgusting how us ?westerners? act as though we are holders of the truth. Has this ever worked?<br/><br/>

This rules: "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/10/enemy.combatant/index.html">As a U.S. citizen, Al Muhajir usually would be afforded traditional legal rights such as presumption of innocence until a conviction</a>." <br/><br/>I think that it is good to take a person?s rights away? I mean what good is a citizens rights.. Especially when they are actual United States citizens. We shouldn?t treat them as such; we should treat them <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safeandfree/index.html">as if they are prisoners</a> from a country we are at war with. Even if there is no country or no war. They are obviously committing treason and shouldn?t be given any rights whatsoever.
