Tonight I went out with a good friend of mine. it is wierd because they are originally k*star's friend. but somehow I grafted them over to be my friend as well. They are real nice. I don't know how k*star doesn it. but she certainly picks god friends. all of her friends are nice. Unfortunantly I got a little ferschnickered tonight and wasn't able to be a big help to k*star when she called me. Tha made me feel bad. I wish that I was able to be a little more helpful toward her. It is hard right now. because I don't know where to throw my hat. I am sure you all understand. I need to goto bed. the room is spinning.<br/><br/> I was messaged this: <a href="ftp://msfe.microsoft.com/outbound/BBerg/">ftp://msfe.microsoft.com/outbound/BBerg/</a>
. so check it out. I am not sure how public or private it is. but it seems interesting.
