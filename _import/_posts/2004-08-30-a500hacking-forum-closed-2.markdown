I have closed the a500hacking.com forums. Basically the forums were full of spam, nonsense, script kiddies and basically just trash. I  decided to cut my losses and just remove it. I saved most of the content <a href="http://3gcoding.com/archives/000014.php">here</a> and <a href="http://3gcoding.com/archives/000015.php">here</a>.

I hate forums ;)
