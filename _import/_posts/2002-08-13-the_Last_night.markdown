last night we went to go and see the movie signs. it was wonderful. I liked it. The first time I asw it.. it was at that crazy chimaman theatre in LA. I wish that was pronounced laa. like I live in laa.. heh. too bad. stupid cars. <br/>After the movie.. hiromi "dragged" us to a bar.. I say dragged... because we didn't really know anyone.. but I wanted to go anyway. I saw some friends there.. which is always nice.<br/><br/>today has been good again..(in terms of links).. we got a <a href="http://taat.planet-d.net/taat/porrasturvat/">game</a> where you throw a little man down stairs in order to get a good score.. and a funny <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ulzkls/Advertisement.htm">ad</a>.. oh and lest I forget.. go <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/davezilla/">here</a><br/><br/>I always wonder why people are surprised when the internet <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/poststandard/index.ssf?/base/news-3/1029230304179082.xml">turns</a> out to be just like real life.

I mean you can't know anything about the person. this is gunna really screw up how kids are sociallized in the future. <br/><br/>has <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_1.html">it</a> started?
