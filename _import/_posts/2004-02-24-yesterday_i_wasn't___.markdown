i was so weird yesterday. I didn't want to be at work. so I just did my work without mentioning a word to anyone - and I reacted poorly when I was spoken too. it was <a href="http://womanstouch.ag.org/womanstouch/newimages/3-4-02/5_20_annoying%20guy.jpg">annoying</a> even to me.. I guess I was coming <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/featuregraphics/2002/07/20020702fossettballoon.jpg">down from the high</a> of my awesome (and tiring) weekend. I just wanted to go home and get a hug from someone. or go home and sleep (which is essentially what I did). It was funny - cuz I really <a href="http://www.digitalstoryteller.com/BTV99/hartley/images/small/0131BNSF_derailment_11-98.jpg">felt weird</a> - as though my batteries had worn down. but as soon as I was eating - I felt sooo much better to the point where I realized that the reason for the season was my lack of eating (the one thing I often forget to do). I need to remind myself to take better care of myself. I am really thinking of <a href="http://www.lovelylowrider.com/bulletbondobike.jpg">getting a bike</a>. but I want one I could possibly afford to lose (i tend to lose big things). I just know I would ride it to a bar and then wake up a week later and remember that it "was" locked to a pole by some bar. I don't think I would be happy if it was some fancy bike. ok. <br/><br/>i am better today though. it is nice to get sleep. I made my bed awesome so sleeping was really exciting. after sleeping it is easy to remember how <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~mysouthernfamily/photos/higginbothamjosephaCSAi17159.jpg">awesome my life really is</a>. ahhh.. umm. yea. <br/><br/>here is how to make a <a href="http://shitbegone.com/moneywallet/index2.html">money wallet</a>. here is how to <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=humor%2Fpictures&img=wrist.gif">ensure death</a> hehe. here is how to be <a href="http://www.rodrickbrown.com/denied.wmv">bummed out</a>. here is <a href="http://www.helenandbarry.com/WilliamHung.wmv">how to dance</a>. <br/><br/>this weekend is going tobe fun. we are having a small get-to-gether(hehe) on friday and then I have tickets to see ludacris and cannibal corpse. sounds like a winner. morgan's roommate is leaving soon so there is also a party for him.. he is really cool. check out his <a href="http://www.parallaxonline.org/index.html">site/company/ethics journal</a>. <br/><br/>don't forget to check out <a href="http://war.watership.org">war.watership.org</a> or to <a href="http://dopeman.org/ambient/">modify my ambient orb</a>.<br/><br/>i am bored today. I accidently went to a meeting that I wasn't supposed to goto. one ofmy bosses was like "harper.. uhh.. you shoudl leave ;)" it ruled. I am teh roxor for sure. hehe.<br/> ok enough
