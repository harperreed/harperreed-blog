Remember that TMBG album.. well it happened to <a href="http://chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-010802flooding.story?coll=chi%2Dnews%2Dhed">chicago</a> today. It was crazy. I was awoke at 7:50 by my <a href="http://www.x10.com">X10</a> lights reacting to thunder and lightning(maybe static electricity?) and then i looked outside and noticed... <b>apocalypse</b>!!! So i got dressed, started my chicken marinade.. and set off to work.. By the time i got to the EL, i was completly soaked.. and just now(6 hours later) i have finally become a little less damp..
