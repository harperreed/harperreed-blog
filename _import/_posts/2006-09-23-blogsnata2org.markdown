I redid this mini site using smarty, magpie rss and some other tricks. It is now pretty nice. I like using wordpress themes. It makes it easier. I can have a decent looking site (they are all blog like anyway) in about 5 minutes. Sometimes its a pain though. But it turned out nice i think.

So anyway, check out the site: <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org/">blogs.nata2.org</a>

All it is, is an aggregate of all my friends blogs. I am got bored - so some functionality is missing. but for the most part it works. and is a lot better than the old one. It should be a bundle of an amount faster too.

Let me know how it works, and if you want your blog on their and it isn't - let me know too.
