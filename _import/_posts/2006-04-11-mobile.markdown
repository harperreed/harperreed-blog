Mobile phones and mobile technology has been a passion of mine since my father got a radio phone back in the day. I always find a way to scheme a new mobile phone and I am always impressed with good mobile technology.

here are some resources i have put together:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.nata2.org/mobile/38-s60-tips-and-tricks/">Nokia Tips and Tricks</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nata2.org/mobile/nokia-codes/">Nokia # Codes</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nata2.org/mobile/s60-3rd-edition-app-list/">S60 Released Software List</a></li>
</ul>
I am sure there will be more later. Stay Tuned.
