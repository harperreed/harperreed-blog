<p>where the deer and the antelope play. where seldom is heard a <a href="http://www.svghd.org/assets/images/pronghorns.jpg" target="_self">discouraging word</a>. and the eyes eat <a href="http://www.ilovethewest.com/swanson/real5.JPG" target="_self">cowboys</a> all day. </p><p>Oh yea. it is the weekend. I am soooo sleepy. I am going to have a meet and greet. and then have a meet and sleep. and then <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2005-07,GGLD:en&amp;q=WHAMO" target="_self">WHAMO</a>. saturday. then sunday. then work. wooohooo</p><p>in the mean time I am going to attempt to hook howtoyoyo into mambo as well as audreyhacking - hopefully by putting all my sites into one CMS I will have a quicker workflow for chanegs and such. or I will get rooted faster. I will also work on my MVC PHP port of <a href="http://www.cripplesmash.com/" target="_self">cripplesmash</a>. I am excited. I wish I had more money. I would buy a mac mini - port <a href="http://www.synchro.net/" target="_self">synchronet bbs</a> to osx - and run a bbs. hah. w00t. the 80s will never die. <a href="http://www.demonisk.net/oppsett/spaceart/some_places_never_die_1400.jpg" target="_self">NEVER DIE</a>.</p><p>oh and maybe I will finally move nata2 to its new design. I have junked the old new design and have placed almost everything into wordpress - so I will hopefully moving forward soon. I had some <a href="http://www3.mistral.co.uk/stgok/dawn.jpg" target="_self">philosophical questions</a> about whether or not to include all my other properties into my blog site - like roll <a href="http://www.harperreed.org/" target="_self">harperreed.org</a>, <a href="http://www.3gcoding.com/" target="_self">3gcoding.com</a> and <a href="../" target="_self">nata2.org</a> into one (with proper separation of course) - or to keep them separate (but equal). nobody knows. <a href="http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~edbauer/blogs/jenny/archives/ann_richards.jpg" target="_self">stupid blogs</a>. </p><p>these are some things I have been looking at on the internet lately: <a href="http://del.icio.us/nata2/adsense" target="_self">adsense</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/nata2/clothing" target="_self">clothing</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/nata2/google" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/nata2/blogs" target="_self">blogs</a></p><p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
