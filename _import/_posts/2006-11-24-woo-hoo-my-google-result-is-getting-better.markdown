<p>So my name is harper. It isn't a very common name, so I have always had luck with being pretty high ranked in the results&nbsp; when a person&nbsp;searches for my full name "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=harper+reed">harper reed</a>," but when you search for my <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=harper">first name</a> I am often beat out by such "cultural giants" as <a href="http://www.benharper.net/">ben harper</a>, <a href="http://www.harpers.org/">harpers magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/">harper's bazaar</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/">harper collins</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollege.edu/">harper college</a>, <a href="http://www.harper.biz/">harper the musician</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/rg/REC_CULT_AND_CLASSIC//title/tt0060490/">harper the movie</a>. But recently my search rank for harper has grown. Just a place by place - little at a time. But finally I am on the front page. Actually I am number 7!&nbsp; whee. </p> <p>Its going to be hard to beat out all the previously mentioned people. I guess I just need to become famous. </p> <p>And this entry will probably be an entry of famous last words - watch out tomorrow as Google suddenly changes its index and I move to page 30. eep.. I wonder if I will affect my rank by linking to my "competitors." hmm. Now I just need to work on getting all ten of the listings for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=harper+reed">harper reed</a>" - stupid shipping insurance companies. </p> <p>Jacob: looks like I am in the "club"... ;-)</p>
