Usually when I blog about Google, I am happy. but today it is a sad sad Google day. For the first time since the days of <a href="http://metacrawler.com/">metacrawler</a>, a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=harper+reed">Harper Reed</a> doesn't return one of my sites as the first hit. This really hurts. I guess I have been slacker at my SEO. Gotta jump back up there. I hope that harperreed.com drops once Google reindexes and notices that their title isn't harper/reed anymore. I just need to make millions of dollars and buy harperreed.com. sad!

<strong>UPDATE:  </strong>I am no longer 2nd. As i expected, harperreed.com dropped once people stopped linking to it in the news. So now i dominate the first page of results. YES. Now i just need to get back on the first page for harper.
