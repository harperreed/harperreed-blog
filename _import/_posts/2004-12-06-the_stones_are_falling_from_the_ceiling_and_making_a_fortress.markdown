i know I haven't updated in a while. do you think you can forgive me? I hope so. we all go through times where computers burn our fingers when we touch them. this wasn't one of those times. I just didn't feel like it. sometimes that happens. but whatever. I am back. for tonight. maybe for a couple days. maybe for a couple months. maybe for just a minute.<br>
<br>
but whatever. so now. I am here.<br>
tonight I worked on this site with a friend of <a href="http://www.elainepark.com">mine</a>. it was pretty fun. I like computers.<br>
<br>
work has been really awesome. I love work when I get to do work. I have been staying pretty late. on friday I worked from 9am until 12am. it ruled. I love working. especially if I am doing exciting things. one of the exciting things I did was put a <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/031220042255/Nokia6600(964).jpg">huge picture</a> of my cousins cow on my wall. it rules. I used the <a href="http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/">rasterbator</a>. yall should check it out.<br>
