Sometimes, just when I think I understand something it explodes and blows up in my face.. making me look silly and dumb. One of those things is corporate culture. I think it is very similar to the rings on a tree, but rather than age - it maps how slow to change the corporation is. Take my <a href="http://www.worldbook.com">institution</a>, it is a very old and rather successful company. Ithas maintained a profit on the web and uses a "good" business model. It was pioneered by <a href="http://www.IBM.com">IBM</a> and managed internally. We are having to face the internet as everyother company has had to face it before us. We need to detirmine what our priorities are and what needs to exist in out "world." The problem is, is that the "new" business of the interenet is fundamentally incompatible with WB's business past. So we are facing the end of a paradigm. We are ending one of the concentric tree rings. We are starting another. but the corporate culture is rejecting this change like a stolen kidney. It is tough. No one wants to play the "internet" game. They all want to "relax." <br/>i got bored of ranting and started finding a WYSIWYG editor for this weblog.. alas... I will be back I imagine
