so I think I got a playstation. It should come soon. I am excited to play GTA3. hehe. it should rule. Nobody will know whoever if it actually will. the graphics better be dope. or I am returning it. haha. Check <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/03/15/eagle.attack/index.html">this</a> out. ;). So work cancelled casual fridays. Which is a rather small deal. However.. I hat edressing up in business clothes. I basically run around and fix/program/.abuse computers all day. I have no client interaction. I meet with vendors rarely. I should be able to dress however I please. I wish that WB would remove it self from the stoneage. it would do better. oh.. check <a href="http://www.digitalfog.com/gallery/lamour.htm">this</a> out, I may have posted it earlier.. but whatever..
