<p><img src="http://sjc-static15.sjc.youtube.com/vi/EZwXCeuvPTY/3.jpg" align="right"> My buddy Todd sent me a <a href="http://digg.com/videos/music/Frank_Zappa_PWNS_interviewer">Frank Zappa interview</a> and from that I ended up watching another, much longer, frank zappa interview. It is from the Dick Cavett show on June 12, 1980. </p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZwXCeuvPTY">Check out part one</a>. Where Frank Zappa talks about the history of punk rock and how new wave is interesting. He also mentions how fashion is the driver toward music movements. </p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTrEllEk6hA">Part two</a> is about Frank Zappa's interaction with the <a href="http://www.adl.org/">ADL</a> about his song <a href="http://www.google.com/musics?lid=eVc7W_7iYZM&amp;aid=w6gEd0PaSsM&amp;sid=JjcP-7JYblL">'Jewish Princess</a>.' Interesting. He also talks about naming his child Moon Unit and how people are insane about music - particularly Elvis. </p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd0ZeN7qfIo">Part Three</a> is about politics in music and music attachment to movements and media. How symbolism in music is often attached to the music for no reason other to partake in a movement. Frank Zappa recites 'Dancing fool' and talks about how profanity in lyrics. </p> <p>If you are not familiar with Frank Zappa&nbsp; please <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa">check him out</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/musica?aid=w6gEd0PaSsM">listen to his music</a>. Its amazing. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:6427016a-944e-4b58-b223-e32029bd03cf" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]music, frank zappa, interview, great, youtube[/tags]</div>
