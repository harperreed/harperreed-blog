The future is obviously data and sharing it.

The <a href="http://dataportability.org/">dataportability.org</a> data portability group is pretty awesome. It has a boatload of pretty cool people who are talking about amazing stuff. I have done what i always do whenever i find a movement that i appreciate  and subscribed to all of the participants blogs.  Good stuff thus far.

If you are interested in reading an aggregate - check out my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/18273797402131469936/label/DataPortability">shared DataPortability tag</a> or subscribe to its <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/18273797402131469936/label/DataPortability">RSS feed</a>. If you want, I have uploaded an <a href="http://dopeman.org/dataportability.opml">OPML of the participants blogs</a>.  Please <a href="http://harperreed.org/contact/">let me know</a> if i have missed anyone.

I can't wait to see what comes out of this group. I hope that i will be able to contribute and use their creation in Threadless and various other application.

stay tuned!
