<a href="http://reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=politicsnews&amp;StoryID=1471464">Bush is now being compared to hitler by his peers</a>. Whoa. <br/>In a surprise move, the UN has <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/story.jsp?story=334645">upset Bush's plans for WAR</a>. I guess they really didn't like his <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/bw-wh/2002/sep/19/091908848.html">plan</a> all that well. Maybe it was because Iraq has <a href="http://www.canada.com/news/story.asp?id=%7BE5A97980-9576-40C6-9197-AA1386309F28%7D">no weapons of mass destrution</a>. 
-- In other news, <a href="http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/4108036.htm">there is absolutely no racial profiling</a> by the air marshals. and the "terrorists" from the south apparently did <a href="http://www.news-press.com/news/today/020919hunter.html">pay their toll</a>. wtf! Maybe the racial profiling that does exist is because of the fact that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/19/politics/19INTE.html?ex=1033099200&amp;en=a9e6095de3e1c203&amp;ei=5006&amp;partner=ALTAVISTA1">no one heeded the warnings</a> about the possibility of a plane attack. And now all warnings are paid <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/DailyNews/moreterror020918.html">strict notice</a>. <br/>poor <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailynews/262/world/Israeli_tanks_enter_Yasser_Ara:.shtml"">yassar</a>

 -- paid toll
