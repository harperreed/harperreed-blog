i was complaining about not having a really solid way to upload images from my phone to my server. I was using my <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fmms2blog">MMS to photolog</a> script, which totally worked good. but I needed a way to get ALL of the pictures from my camera to my server without havign to bluetooth them and then ftp them and then move them. so I found <a href="http://www.mylesgrant.com/braindump/older/2004/02/18/php_nokia_image_upload_server_02_release.html">this php nokia image server</a> , configured it, rewrote a bit of it. and BAM now my pictures upload directly to the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600">nata2.info section for my cell phone</a>. RULE. now it is time to go home. maybe later I will integrate it with jhead to tag them for date and such. and maybe use the mysql support to do a real photolog. not the ghetto version I got now. hah. we shall see. <b>;)</b>. <br/>cameraphone Ho!
