today everything I am wearing is either grey or black. even my underwear and socks. it is kinds funny. I didn't mrean to and I didn't really think about it until I was on the train. but yea. everything is grey. hah.<br>
<br>
it is still sad out today. the weather is nice though. the sun. however it is cold. it is kinda how I feel right now.<br>
<br>
last night morgan sent me an email that really made me feel better. of course I didn't get it until this morning - cuz I broke email again. haha. but I fixed it. but yea. it is funny how little words can make or break so much.<br>
<br>
i am currently really into listening to "explosions in the sky." very good. exactly what I need. anything with vocals has the potential of invoking emotions which I don't really want to share with my work environment.<br>
<br>
i really didn't want to get up today. I enjoyed my super weird dreams and soft blankets.<br>
<br>
i think that today my goal is to try and buy a damned bike. I have attempted with failure for the last 2 days. hah. stupid christians and their "holidays." we all know it is a ploy to sell chocalate and jesus.<br>
<br>
one of the things that is interesting about the last couple days. first off - nothing really went how I wanted it. since about wednesday. it all broke. haha. but starting yesterday - they started to patch themselves up. everything. it is like there was a flaw in the world of harper karma - and now it is coming back. sometimes when bad stuff happens it really makes you remember how lucky you are. overall. yea yea yea. <b>;)</b>
