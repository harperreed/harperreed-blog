<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/147086702/"><img align="right" title="05152006491" alt="05152006491" src="http://static.flickr.com/45/147086702_0be1483156_m.jpg" /></a>So my friend liz sent me a belated birthday gift. It was some of her mens geek jewlery from her pretty successful <a href="http://zellestyle.com/">zellestyle</a> line of stuff. Neat stuff. She sent me a <a href="http://www.fractalspin.com/x/product.php?productid=20&cat=0&page=2">midi bracelet</a> and some little nice black wire bracelets. I am happy because i had just thought about wearing bracelets again and i was tired of my custom devil gauntlets that i used to wear. Thanks liz.
