I am watching tv and the women on the TV has awesome glasses. they are huge. I am watching a pretty sad documentary about two kids from chicago poor neighborhoods that are trying to get into the NBA. it is good. a bummer. life certainly isn't fair.

This weekend rocks. 
Last night was the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A07%3A22_lollapalooza_preparty">lollapalooza preparty at crobar</a>. it was madness. Chris Holmes is here, Tommie Sunshine is here,  everyone is back. it rules. just like the old days. Friday was a great party at crobar. Chris brought in a bunch of cool people to dj. <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=%22Zoe%20bonham%22&hl=en&hs=cIc&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&sa=N&tab=wi">Zoe bonham</a>, <a href="http://www.davidjonline.com">david j</a>, and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001166/">jimmy duval</a>. heh. oh yea.. and <a href="http://thecobrasnake.com/partyphotos/voxcrobarvox/index.html">cobrasnake was there too</a>.
