So i set up my new server last night. You can visit it by going to <a href="http://www.dopeman.org">dopeman.org</a>. Its real real nice. hehe. Dual P3 700mhz, 1gig ram, dual 9 gig scsi drives.. damn is it fast. I am running apache, PHP, MYSQL, Qmail, Qpopper,. It rules. I am using the <a href="http://www.zend.com">Zend</a> Optimizer coupled with the <a href="http://bwcache.bware.it/cache.htm">BWARE</a> cache to speed up PHP. Today, i am gunna tweak apache like a mofo and then i will secure it like a fortress.. heh.
