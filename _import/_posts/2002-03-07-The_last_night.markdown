last night I watched rosemary's baby. hehe. how fun. I like tha movie. You all have to check out <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/ladybug/">this</a> game. It is quite nice. Also check out <a href="http://www.crpuzzles.com/">this</a> site for some fun puzzles. heh. <br/><br/>i am so sleepy. I stayed up wyay late last night. I shouldn't have. hehe. I had an oppurtunity to hit the sack quite early - like 2:00.. but no. had to saty up til three. hehe. whoops. maybe later I will be able to sleep. I love <a href="http://www.fuckedcompany.com/images/view.cfm?image=deltaupsilon_small.jpg">fraternities</a> and sororities. They obviously <a href="http://www.dailynebraskan.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/03/01/3c7f48521cda1?in_archive=1">rule</a>. I remember in college when I was a unaffiliated representative for the greek council - hah what a joke. But what would I know. I jsut wanted to fit in and have friends. obviously. <br/><br/>So I want to talk about interaction. however I don't want to engage in full disclosure to the world. I am annoyed that it isn't easy to maintain things..
