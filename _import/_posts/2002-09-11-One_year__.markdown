So one year ago about now I was arriving at work and noticed how everyone was leaving. a friend had woke me up early to tell me about the first plane.. and then the second. it was weird.. I learned about most of this on <a href="http://www.aim.com">AIM</a>. So I then went to work. Like I said.. all I remember was all the people streaming out of buildings. I came to my office sat there. noticed the news sites were all down.. read slashdot.. was like.. WTF. Then my building was evacuated. I remember getting a call shortly after that from my father. in colorado... it was reported that chicago was also attacked so my parents thought I may have been in a targeted building.. I then went home and read <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/09/11/1547207">slashdot</a>. After hearing that people had a problem getting to media sites and not finding any media myself.. I started wgeting all of the media I could find. which is how I got <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2F09-11-2001">this</a> archive of media. It was a weird day altogether. I took a nap.. then I helped a friend jump her car. and then I got sad. because I thought we were going to goto war. I was so scared about war. I still am. but I assumed that bush would really screw things up. His staff seemed so incompetent. good thing I wasn't right. HA. <br/><br/>Anyway. I think it is a good time to awknoledge those who gave their lives trying to help and save others. good job. you will be missed. <br/><br/>Look <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/09/1318236&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=103&amp;threshold=3">here</a> for commentary from slashdot. More to come later perhaps..
