I am sitting here waiting for this program i wrote that parses log files to finish, and reading news online. I am trying hard not to read anything about Bush. Cuz he scares the hell out of me. Headlines lie "Bush states that the US WILL withdraw from missile treaty" and "Bush appoints Air Force Man to joint chiefs of staff" and other scary cold warish things. I think that the sign of a bad president is when things DO happen. At least with clinton, when we were on the verge of war, it was mostly the other countries fault. Now, we are building are war machine. WTF. I don't want to try and survive a war, i don't want to have to deal with that. The US is not the only World Power now. And bush is acting as though the red bastards are coming. But rather than acting nice like clinton he is inviting an attack, and then the conservatives(bush and his lot, not the cool guys) will say "i told you so." I hope you youngins are planning to run...
