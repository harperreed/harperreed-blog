title: 300 terabytes is a lot
excerpt: |
  Today I visited another tier one hosting provider. It was nuts. Absolutly nuts. One of the cage facilities had a 300 terabyte tape drive. It looked like a space ship - or a nucular reactor. It was nuts. It probably cost enough to send my entire family to private liberal arts colleges in the midwest :)....
