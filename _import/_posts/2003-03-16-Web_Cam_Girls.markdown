heh. so I stayed up real late tonight looking at web cam girl pages. what a weird world that is. I don't quite understand it. Such a voyeuristic world we have here. <br/><a href="http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20030315/i/1047738430.2885836894.jpg">poor</a> weird cat.<br/><br/>
Sometimes the internet is not <a href="http://www.martinlutherking.org/">amusing</a>. It took me far too long to realize that site was ran by racists.. for a real blow to rationality check out the whitepower <a href="<a href="http://kids.stormfront.org/">kids site</a> or maybe the whitepower <a href="http://women.stormfront.org/">womens site</a>. hmm.. no good at all. whereas <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/wire/2003/03/14/toddler/index.html">this</a> is obviously good ;)
