Last night I went to this electro party. it was OK. it was a HUGE space and their was not enough people to fill it up. However - it was rather well executed and overall it did a good job as a party. my friend <a href="http://www.chris.fm">Chris</a> DJ'd and that ruled.. but some cats were pissed.. cuz his headphones were similiar to their previously stolen ones. wtf. <br/><br/>speaking of headphones. - I got my new ones. seriously dope. I am sitting here in a coffee shop.. listening to my IPOD and there is a LOT of noise. I see everyone look up and stare at a car. hiromi looks at me and starts talking.. so I disengage my eargoggles and ask her what happened.. apparently a car drove by and made quite a ruckus.. I didn't even hear. it ruled. so so much. well.. my food is here.
