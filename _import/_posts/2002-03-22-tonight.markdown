i title many blgs tonight. I don't know what the deal is. So I am now twenty four. I had an ok birthday. It was nothing special - however I went and hung out at my favorite bar. Which is sorta fun. actually quite a bit of fun. matiss and I chilled there for awhile and watched crazy japanese snuff,rape,horror movies. not real good but an interesting view none the less. <br/>I also went and saw le tigre tonight. they are quite something. I really enjoyed them. I have them in my head as I write this. but the magic of the night was tracy and the plastics. they ruled. quite fun. tonight I am supposed to goto the plaid show. I hope it is cool.. and tomarrow I am supposed to go OUT OUT OUT. wheee. maybe I will get lucky.. just kidding.. hehe..
