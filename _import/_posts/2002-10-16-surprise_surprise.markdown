India is starting to <a href="http://www.canada.com/news/story.asp?id=%7BA732E85F-B0F7-4276-927A-DB3ECF84D380%7D">withdraw</a> from pakistani borders. COuld this be the desentegration of the powderkeg like climate the world is exhibiting? I doubt it <b>:(</b><br/><br/>whatever.. most of this is drivel. war war war. .it is all out of our hands. I mean have anyone of you talked to someone who thinks that we should be going to war? I mean it doesn't really make sense, unless you are trying to get money for your friends who are defense contractors.. it is horrifying to think that big business is gunna send my friends to war. stupid stupid friends.<br/><br/>check out <a href="http://www.truth.org">truth.org</a> - it is incredible. A great idea. <br/>i think I see ghosts.
