i feel a lot better. wirk is good. my relationship with k*star is no longer, well I mean it is still there.. but we have decided to take a little break. I hope with all of my heart that it is little.. But we part as friends.. and we really didn't part. It is still really sad.. but I am getting through it. I ordered a new laptop... ha new.. I ordered a laptop. I am excited. it is obviously a post breakup impulse buy.. but I need a new computer.. or is that just what I say to justify things.. hmm..<br/><br/>
I fear releasing my feelings. I don't want to let them go. such memories. such times. I will never forget..
