This is from a couple days ago but whatever:<br>
A report was released by a bunch of British physicians that said that <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993043">"A war against Iraq could kill half a million people, warns a new report by medical experts - and most would be civilians."</a>. Looks like we don't need to worry about anything. Oh yea - <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-966311.html">A secretive federal court on Monday granted police broad authority to monitor Internet use, record keystrokes and employ other surveillance methods against terror and espionage suspects.</a> - I guess I better watch it. ;) especially now that the chinese have <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20021120-2387.htm">missiles that can reach places of interest.</a> But if we don't get nuked - we can always hope for democrats to come back and the <a href="http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2071929">stock market</a> to come back and play. In a weird twist.. the <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/opinion/ny-vpcoc143002251nov14,0,7803300.column?coll=ny%2Dviewpoints%2Dheadlines">White House</a> is waging a secretive war on condoms. Totally makes sense. Maybe they are preparing to woe some of our more conservative allies for <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/news/story.jsp?floc=FF-PLS-PLS&amp;id=11201131000283576&amp;dt=20021120113100&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview=">help</a> with a really poor war plan.<br>
<br>
Oh. I am attempting seed <a href="http://www.googlism.com">googlism</a> to have something for my name and nata2. Here I go:
<blockquote><small>nata2 is in the house.<br>
nata2 is god overall<br>
nata2 is heavenly ;)<br>
harper reed is the ruler of all<br>
harper reed is an angry angry old man - uhh<br></small></blockquote>
anyway..
