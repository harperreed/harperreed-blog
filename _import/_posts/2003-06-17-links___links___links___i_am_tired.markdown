First I have an interesting article about <a href="http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/foldoc/59/101.htm">Russell's Paradox</a>. and then the related article about how <a href="http://www.reuters.com/financeNewsArticle.jhtml?type=businessNews&amp;storyID=2942278">SUVs are not really safe</a>. which of course leads us to the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-617jobs,0,2258424.story?coll=sfla-home-headlines">horrible U.S. job market</a>. <br/>WHen I was a smaller person.. I used to have matiss sign my credit cards. he often would <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/credit/index.html">draw little pictures</a>. it was humorous. this is an <a href="http://webmd.lycos.com/content/article/16/1728_55035">interesting article about afrodisiacs</a>. mmm... good and plenty's. apparently, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/06/17/frogs_fine030617">this</a> is what happens when you have too many frogs. <br/><br/>and woah.. it appears the government may have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2760-2003Jun16.html?nav=hptop_tb">LIED about the jessica lynch deal</a>. weird.
