  I am in a truck stop in indiana eating some food. We should get into columbus around 2 or so. Then I will be installing my servers tomorrow. It is kinda nerve racking. Cuz I gotta do good ;).
  
  
  The drive is fun. I forgot how bogan indiana is. It reminds how fun the indy 500 is. Haha. I gotta find me some race fans. Flourescent colored shirts and all. Hah.maybe I will drive ...

The drive is fun. I forgot how bogan indiana is. It reminds how fun the indy 500 is. Haha. I gotta find me some race fans. Flourescent colored shirts and all. Hah.<br/><br/>maybe I will drive later - even though my license is expired. Eep.<br/><br/>umm apparently <a href="http://dylanreed.org">dylan</a> has a good link. I don't know. I am on a sidekick. My food just came.
