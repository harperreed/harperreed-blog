I am bored.. and I want to know a lot about my new phone. so what better way then start a website dedicated to learning all I can about my new phone..  <br/><br/>So last night I went to a couple parties. It was fun. One was a "indie rocker house party" that I was invited to by my friend angela.. it was fun. I saw my friend cole there. randomly. I didn't expect to see anyone at the party I knew.. so it was a pleasent surprise. we just hung out and acted strange.. heh. how weird. ey. The other party was a birthday party for my friend edie. it was fun. everyone was party-in hard. haha. so much dancing. but in the middle of the best song.. ludacris- whats your fantasy - the cd broke.. ugh.. so sad.<br/><br/>so.. apparently the women who told the cops that "those crazy arab guys were terrorists" might be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/09/13/alligator.alley/index.html">lying..</a>.. weird... imagine that.
