So I keep breaking my computer. When I break it I usually boot <a href="http://www.qnx.com">QNX 6.1</a> off of a CD so I can have email and web access. however I was interested in using AIM so I quickly downloaded an AIM client for QNX. It happens to be a text only client so its kinda like old style ircii. It was all going great untili started core dumping randomly all day. I couldn't figure it out, until a friend messaged me and was like.. Everytime I message you from my other client you sign off. So I guess my client didn't like his buddy name. heh. here is the log:<br/>
