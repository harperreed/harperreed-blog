what up.. haha. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fharper_and_friends&img=firebreathing.jpg">here</a> is a good picture. heh. <br/><br/>anyway. tonight was great. I guess I have a lot of great nights.  I went to a friends b-day party. all sorts of fun. dancing.. and trancing.. music is the answer... anyway.. all of the girls I have crushes on were at the party.. and I danced with all of them.. heh.. too bad I am scared of girls ;) hehe. besides the crushes, ;).. I hung out with really great friends. it is so nice to hang out with people who are nice. <br/>Today is also special.. because we went <a href="http://www.timelapse.com">live</a> on a website that I have worked on for a very long time. .. which is super exciting becuase we have worked soo hard. I hope that the sales roll in. it would RULE.
