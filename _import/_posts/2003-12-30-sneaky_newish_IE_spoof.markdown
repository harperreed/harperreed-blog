to solve the problem with virus scanners and such I have relocated this spoof to <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/spoof.html">here</a>
<br/>that should work. for more info check out <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/12/12.html#a1062">here</a> or <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2003/12/12/IEExploitDemo.html">here</a>.<br/> weird eh.. <Br><br/>i am tired and hungry. mostly hungry. I think tonight I am going to take the time to clean my <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1072549960-t610(1).jpg">messy room</a>. eep. while I was showering today I thought how nice it would be to be able to have a shell on my desktop without ssh - so I almost convinced myself to buy a 12" powerbook. man I would really like one. it would be so fun. cuz then I would be able to irc from it natively with <a href="http://www.scrollz.com/">scrollz</a>. haha. how irc has ruined my life.... oh yea.. check out the <a href="http://corp.dopeman.org/stats.html">stats</a> ;). <br/><br/>phillip torrone's <a href="http://www.philliptorrone.com/option3/">project</a> to take a picture every thirty minutes turned out really cool. I wish I woudl have stuck with my idea of taking pictures of everything I ate. it didn't really go over that well. mostly cuz the day I started I happened to be at a resturant/bar and it was more bar than resturant and I kept taking sloppy pictures. stupid pictures.. <br/><br/>soemday I will get my new servers up.
