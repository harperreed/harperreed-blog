So work got hard again. everyone is super stressed and really getting down about this project. I am confident it will be resolved soon enough. we just have to do it ;)<br/>in the meantime, we shoudl all be playing <a href="http://web.utanet.at/nkehrer/ONE_Play.html">NES</a> and then download <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/classics/">GTA</a> and go killin. <br/><br/>
