I was reading through a bunch of sites and I noticed some quite interesting movements in the "world." First off, the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/42521.html">incredible epiphany</a> that two thrids of the world thinks that the U.S. is brought the terror onto itself. Also, in a very scary move, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20011221-95780908.htm">China</a> has apparently been subtly supporting the al-Qaeda. Whoa. I hope bush does not take on the big red. Oh, and I guess the FBI and CIA are looking into a domestic threat of tactical <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20122001-044906-9007r">nukes</a>, and they think that <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20122001-044449-5310r">nukes me already be here</a>. And in local new - <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0112210378dec21.story?coll=chi%2Dnews%2Dhed">chicago</a> is number one in murder for the country. Rule!! I feel so safe.
