i fixed it. well I thought I did. until it wouldn't reload. I think that our internet <a href="http://www.worldbook.com">here</a> is really slow. I can't even ssh to my boxen. weird. and dumb. wierd and dumb. together at last. man it has been a long caffiene drenched day. umm. yea. so anyway. my original post was going to be like this: so I modified my photolog recently - I made it so the most recent picture shows up on all the pages and then I revamped the photolog to be displayed by month. it looks a little better and is quite a bit quicker. however I could <a href="http://www.xcassociates.com/pics/LEAP.JPG">significantly increase</a> the speed if I wasn't reading the directory as much. I am lazy though and don't want to learn perl DB stuff. heh. but anyway. it looks pretty good. I think with the advent of my 6600 -  I will make the perl script that posts the pictures resize and submit the filenames and such to a db. it will be oh so much faster then it is now. <br/><br/>last night we all hung out at my house and yoyoed and chilled. it was fun. I learned about 3 super nifty yoyo tricks and I really am excited to goto juggling tonight. whippee. <br/><br/><a href="http://morgan.attacktexas.com">morgan</a> got a <a href="http://www.crunch.com">promotion</a>. nice work. <br/><br/>tired. nap time is fast approaching. I think I have tricked my body into wanting naps everyday from  4-7. it is OK but also suxors. cuz I get sleepy REAL easy. but tonight I will have PLENTY of time to sleep before juggling. k. I have accupuncture again on thursday. I think she will say the same stuff: you shoudl do an activity that stretches your shoulders" - I shoudl do an activity that makes me move altogether. I really am feeling like I shoudl by a bike. I will probably get a really simple hybred? hmm like a used bike that isn't a mountain bike but isn't a road bike. and screw the track bikes. I just need one to get around in the <a href="http://www.mts.net/~mkrieger/folio/spring.jpg">spring and summer</a>. I guess I also have to start goign places. suddenly this got to be really complicated. maybe I will lease an m3 instead. hah.<br/><br/>so today on boingboing there were some really good links. first off - rachel's friend <a href="http://matthew.onigami.net/">matthew</a> was <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004_03_01_archive.html#107877117041941091">listed</a>. that is pretty cool. <a href="http://www.mobagallery.org/index.html">this</a> museum seems entertaining.  having watched a small amount of bollywood movies - I found <a href="http://www.freeorange.net/archives/2004/Mar/09/top_ten_rules_of_indian_filmmaking.htm">this</a> to be amusing. reality is often replicating <a href="http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/D/DEAR_ABBY_SIMPSONS?SITE=MIDTN&amp;SECTION=ENTERTAINMENT&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">television</a> - or not.  <a href="http://underground.zork.net/">eep</a>
