Recently hiromi and myself sent some gifts to a friend of ours in taiwan. I sent her a hoody and hiromi sent her a skirt. <a href="http://www.wretch.cc/album/show.php?i=pzella&b=7&f=1115999964&p=2">here</a> is a picture of her with the goods. 

last night mark and i searched far and wide for some superbling for our yoyos. we were not successful. but i did find a great place to buy wholesale stuff. 

and i went to amara's bday party at bungalow. how nice.
