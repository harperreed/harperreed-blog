however.. there is one downside.. the songs do sound the same. but mike said it best:
<blockquote><small>
<strong>Mike Compton:</strong> wtf, every one of these songs sounds the same <br />
<strong>Home Aim:</strong> haha <br />
<strong>Mike Compton:</strong> i was all "wow, this is a long song" it was actually already on track 3 <br />
</small></blockquote>

hehe. LUNCH TIME!
