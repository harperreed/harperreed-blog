I have been watching the shittiest TV lately. It is horrible. horrible. I watched 4 hours of hallmark tv. first a movie about christmas and then some movie about some heart wrenchy crap. it was so bad. so i changed channels and watched TNT. First i watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0113845/">money train</a>, then <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0105104/">passenger 57</a> and then i watched a bunch of the <a href="http://www.logoonline.com/">logo network</a>. The logo network has such interesting documentaries. Right now i am watching a <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0462757/">documentary about butch lesbians</a>. it is awesome.

It is so interesting how almost every parent in this documentary says that their child being a lesbian is just a phase. It is pretty interesting. I don't quite know what i think of that. So strange.

I need to get my <a href="http://www.mrbling.com">grill done</a>. Yall should buy me some. DO IT.
