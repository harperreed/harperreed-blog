so I am going to make a post not on that topic. doh!
<br/><br/>
so morgan picked me up a copy of the <a href="http://www.economist.com/">economist</a>. the cover is seriously the <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/threetogo.jpg">best thing ever</a>. I think I might subscribe. I also want to subscribe to a military journal as well. I don't know what. probably something rather conservative. something like  <a href="http://www.janes.com/">janes</a> - but on paper.  and then maybe <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/about/index.html">Mother Jones</a>. oh and <a href="http://harpers.org">harpers</a> (have you noticed how almost everything named harper <a href="http://harpers.org/MostRecentIndex.html">rules</a>? I sure have). I really wish that all of this info was available in an embedded news reader in my glasses. I always end up destroying magazines. they are so fragil. heh. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.proxientunit.com">mike</a> is rightfully <a href="http://www.proxientunit.com/archives/000162.html">disturbed</a> by <a href="http://www.erotech-industries.com/">this (nsfw)</a>. weird eh. I love computers. and their friends. <bR><br/>i am seriously considering getting a bike. I think it would be fun to ride to work. and I woudl be in much better shape because of it. I am thinking of getting a hybrid - cuz I don't like skinny skinny tires. and I am thinking about dropping the gears to a bare bare minimum. also something not to expensive. so all you bike riders out there.. let me know what you think. I talked to my friend who lives and works near me. and she said that it wasn't that big of a deal. you sweat a lot - so you bring your clothes with you. but that it was nice. and terrifying. that is the part I am leery about. but I will get a helmet. it will rule. <br/><bR>ok I am hungry now. lunch time.
