title: Lampreys
excerpt: So ihad this very strange dream. I dremt that lamprey like fish had started to colonize humans. They would come and dig themselves down your throat and when you breathed they would just pass the air through them and you "wouldn't" notice. I mean you would notice but you were still able to breathe "normally." Well anyway, the lampreys were attaching themselves to humans and a regiment was created...

So ihad this very strange dream. I dremt that lamprey like fish had started to colonize humans. They would come and dig themselves down your throat and when you breathed they would just pass the air through them and you "wouldn't" notice. I mean you would notice but you were still able to breathe "normally." Well anyway, the lampreys were attaching themselves to humans and a regiment was created to purge yourself of the lamprey. What you had to do is first pull the one out of your throat. Since it is never comfortable to have anything forced down your throat, this was an uncomfortable exercise. So you had to grab the head of the lamprey and pull as hard as you could. Eventually they developed tongs to grab the lampreys. After you got the big lamprey out of your throat, you ahd to force yourself to laugh or chuckle, because that rolled your stomach muscles in a strange fashion - this killed the babies and eggs the larger lamprey laid. They would then release a chemical which would make your stomach reject them, and you would puke small clear lampreys. Anyway, this dream was wierd and i hope it never comes true...
