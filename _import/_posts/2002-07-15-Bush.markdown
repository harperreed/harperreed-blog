bush and cheney get to have a good time justifiing their actions soon. It looks as though cheney <a href="http://library.northernlight.com/FB20020714470000019.html?cb=0&amp;dx=1006&amp;sc=0#doc">knew about some of the sketchy business practices</a> that he questioned. It also is strange that the person that bush picked to be the head of corporate task force was <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/news/ns/story.jsp?floc=FF-PLS-PLS&amp;id=403959968&amp;dt=20020713185500&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview=">was previously</a> the head of a credit-card company that paid more than $400 million to settle allegations of unfair and deceptive business practices. Nice work. and one of the most exciting news is that the U.S. may <a href="http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&amp;doc_id=208698">lose 5% of its GDP because of the bankruptcies</a>.. thats rough.. and after an intense investigation the shocking <a href="http://library.northernlight.com/FE20020715440000099.html?cb=0&amp;dx=1006&amp;sc=0#doc">discovery, that bush's priorities may be out of wack</a>.<br/><br/>i guess today wasn't so bad. work was fine. I did a lot of neat coding. I am almost finished with this web application.. I may have gotten some more work. whee. I am excited both to have too much work to do and to not do any work. what a dichotomy. eh. <br/>i am currently reading a book about two kids that grew up in the projects here in chicago. It is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385265565/nata2productions">There Are No Children Here</a>. It always makes me sad to read books like this. the hopelessness.. it is rough. When you combine a story like this.. and show the rough core of the U.S. and then you show the collapse of our economy and our strong moral <a href="http://www.bitchmech.com">fibre</a>.. it leads me to wonder when our country will go the way of th U.S.S.R. hah. it is scary.
