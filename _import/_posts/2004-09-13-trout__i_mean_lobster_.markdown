i really want to go dancing - big band style. all of a sudden. or just watch triplets of belleville. something. just not be up or at work. I am tired of wearing "business casual" clothing. I really want to just wear jeans. or whatever. just something that isn't "<a href="http://www.businesscasualdress.com/illustration.jpg">business casual</a>." I suppose I will get over it. ;) I go through these feelings once every couple months and I usually get over it. I do like dressing up. I just hate being constrained with what I wear. I guess if I had client interaction(or clients) I would be more interested in dressing up. but I sit in a cubicle and listen to death metal. so wtf. <br/><br/>this weekend ruled. on friday I didn't do anything. watched a crazy hong kong movie called <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_are_going_to_eat_you/">we are going to eat you</a> and then played some of my new favorite <a href="http://www.zelda.com/fourswords/launch/">video game</a>. I am goign to beat/solve it in the next week. I decided. I am pretty far. I haven't played a video game this much since kings quest 6. or the orginal gta. or doom. or quake 1,3,2. or doom 3. wait a sec. heh. I gotta go. <br/><br/>so I got up midday saturday. and hung out. then went to my friend <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(518).jpg">genies bday party</a>. it was pretty fun. I hung out with my friend <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(514).jpg">courtney</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(521).jpg">brock</a>. it was at my friend john's place. he has an <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(519).jpg">amazing patio system</a>. it ruled. then I slept. <br/><br/>then I woke up. and went to claudia's house where a "<a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(526).jpg">lobster bbq</a>" was in progress. it ruled. we had <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(524).jpg">22lbs</a> of lobster to decimate. <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(528).jpg">marco cooked</a>. ivan made <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(527).jpg">mad strong drinks</a>. and <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(531).jpg">i ate</a>. it was a pretty <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(529).jpg">fun</a> day. <br/><br/>after awhile we ended up shotgunning ice house. heh. umm yea. we are still in college. and then I met up with elaine and went to darkroom. where I consumed water. and then I rode my bike home and slept until monring. like a good boy.
