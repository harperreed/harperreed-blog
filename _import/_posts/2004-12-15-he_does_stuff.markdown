so I have been reading the rabbit series of books by john updike. they are pretty good. I started with "rabbit redux" and just finished "rabbit, run" last night. after I finished "rabbit, run" I immediately started "rabbit is rich." anyway. I have been thinking about rabbit and what I like/dislike about him in these books. well I don't really like him in "rabbit, run" - I think he is obviously the anti-hero, a destroyer; however I do like him in "rabbit redux." he seems like things are happening to him and he is reacting - reacting strangely - but still reacting; whereas in "rabbit, run," rabbit is being a punk. he makes me mad. which I enjoy. <Br><br/>i need to do work.
