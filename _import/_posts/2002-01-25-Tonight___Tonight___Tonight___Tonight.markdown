Well. Tonight I slept. Well I went to a bar after work with coworkers got a little tippsy and ate a hamburger.. came home and slept till eleven. and then negated any sleep by staying up way late. I then watched a bunch of TV and rotted my mind. Sometimes.. I feel like contirbuting to the delinquency of my palm pilot. So I keep looking at all the nifty INFOSEC stuff available right now. Like all the jobs and such. it makes me wonder. It sucks(well not really) though.. cuz my curretn job is fun and cool - if it wasn't I would totally be on the INFOSEC bandwagen. If anyone is interested: the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov">fbi</a> is looking for a few good people. <b>HA</b>. You should apply.
