i hate being sick. it totally blows. I love black metal. I really don't know how they are related. but I have listened to black metal for the last couple months. and it rules. today was all emporer.
<br/><br/>i got bored of choosign music for my ipod - so I let itunes do it this time. it did a pretty good job. I am proud. <br/><br/>anyway. last night I played yoyo and cleaned my room. it was cool. I got these new bearings for my yoyojam hitmen (:P) and they are <a href="http://www.dif-e-yo.com/konkave.htm">"konkave"</a> so the string rests on the center and then the yoyo acts very smooth. rico suave. it rules. tricks for years. <br/><br/>

check this out. haha. <a href="http://nata2.info">nata2.info</a> rules. it has an <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=nata2.info">alexa traffic rank</a> of 96,525 and is constantly being blocked by web proxies. haha. my friends told him this:
<blockquote>

The site you requested is blocked under your organization's filtering policy. It fits into the following filtering category(ies) that your organization has chosen to block: <br/>
Tasteless/Gross, Jokes, Profanity, Nudity, Sex
</small>
</blockquote>
the best part is - that I put all my pictures and such there - so everyone I know "goes" there to check stuff out. but they have to wade through pounds and pounds of stuff that is catagorized as "Tasteless/Gross, Jokes, Profanity, Nudity, Sex." I rule. <br/><br/>oh oh oh. I remember. I have a new site. it is a pretty cool little site for jokes. most are really bad. but I kept thinkgin to myself - I should write these jokes I have in my head down. and then I was like. naw. I don't want to do any of that work. so I made this new site: <br/>
<a href="http://jokesareawesome.com/">http://jokesareawesome.com/</a>
<br/>
it rules. it took like 2 hours to build.  and hopefully the joke library will grow. whee. <br/><br/>tonight is crobar rock night. it should be fun. if you want to go - show up and drop my name. haha. so funny. but yea. I am going to dinner with s friend and then to crobar. the sad thing is that I am sick - and that my friend sarah and her fiance matt are in town - but I have to "work." and by work I mean goto a club and be cool. I love my life. programming web apps. fixing servers. makign yoyo sites. yoyoing. clubbing. ladies and finally being awesome. oh yes. it is true. <br/><br/>i will probably regret being such a dork at some point. but not now. that is for damn sure. <br/><br/>i want my bike.
