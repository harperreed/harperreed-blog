tonight I went to spybar and as I left. I saw this HUGE pole fall onto incoming traffic at the 90/94 on ramp on ontario. it was INSANE. a HUGE pole. it crashed and went accross the ENTIRE street. so of course I ran over there to survey the damage. right as we ran (me and some homeless guys) a couple cars jumped the pole and crashed. it was insane. so we got to the pole and all traffic was stopped. so we grabb ed the pole and four of us pulled it out of the street. then I caught a cab and came home.<br>
