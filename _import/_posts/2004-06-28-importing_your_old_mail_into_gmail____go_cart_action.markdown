so today over lunch I decided it would be a good idea to import my old  email into gmail. it rules. check out the <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/">tool</a> that I am using. written by <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/">mark lyon</a>. it works pretty well - albeit very slow. but whatever. I will just have it go in the background. <br/><br/>my server has a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=wow_nata2speed.gif">lot of bandwidth</a>. seriously. <br/><br/><a href="http://nata2.info/humor/movies/dont_ever_get_this_drunk.wmv">this </a> is pretty bad. <br/><br/>i have listened to twisted sister's "burn in hell" a billion times today and it isn't getting very old.
