<p>Mos def is one of my favorite artists and "Whats Beef" is one of my favorite songs with him and Talib Kweli.  Check out <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=9tFEj1OeqN0">the video</a> from chappelle's show.   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCzreC2g3-8">This one</a> is also really good.</p>
<p>Someday i will meet mos def and i will say  "Yo Mos. I really like your work" and he will look at me and say "no problem. anytime."
