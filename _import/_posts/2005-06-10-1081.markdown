So i can walk now. that is an improvement. The best part is that it totally left as fast as it came. really weird. or not weird. 

So i made some posts over at <a href="http://3gcoding.com/">3gcoding</a>. basically i updated it with a <a href="http://3gcoding.com/2004/12/26/powerbook-picture-frame/">couple</a> <a href="http://3gcoding.com/2004/09/15/21/">entries</a> i should have posted awhile ago and then i <a href="http://3gcoding.com/2005/06/10/juicebox-hacking/">added a new one</a>. check them out here: <a href="http://3gcoding.com/">3gcoding.com</a>.

now is sleep. sleep is good. 

wait wait. <a href="http://nasa.versionfest.com/">check out my new site</a>. don't sign up yet. it is just a test. but it rules. The cool thing is that andy and i have inadvertently build a generic framework for stuff. The application could theoretically be used to track about anything a community needs to track. when it is done I am going make some simple modifications and release it as <a href="http://railsindex.com">railsindex.com</a>. I am almost thinking about releasing the source as gpl - because i really think people could use this.  yep.
