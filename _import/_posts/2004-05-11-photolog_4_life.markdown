i can't figure out how to get prepaid gprs.<br/> so no photolog. :( sad day. <br/><br/>oh and before I forget. they played classic rock elevator muzak in the domestic flight here. like joe walsh and such. it ruled. I was like: "i suddenly recognize these songs.. weird." it ruled. the same muzak is apparently everywhere. like in the bathroom and the kfc. haha. why was I in a kfc? I don't know. it was pretty tasty though. much better than kfc in chitown [RPZNT]
