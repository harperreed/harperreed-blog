First off - <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=jV1bRfLHA3A">this is the most amazing music video</a> i have ever seen. There is very little hyperbole in that statement. And since jacob has shown me that music video, i have been listening to muse like a madman. Such a funny video. Amazing.

Second - i made <a href="http://www.hiromiandharper.com">this website</a> that aggregates hiromi and my blogs and flickr pictures into a nice little website. So you can check it out our posts and pictures all in one place. the url is <a href="http://www.hiromiandharper.com">hiromiandharper.com</a>. check it out.
