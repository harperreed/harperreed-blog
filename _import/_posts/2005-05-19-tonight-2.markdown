i watched godfather part 3, did some stuff for <a href="http://music-101.com">arman</a>, updated musicblogger.org, updated <a href="http://3gcoding.com">3gcoding.com</a>, fixored up <a href="http://therats.org">matiss's site</a> and cooked some food. and by cook i mean assembled sandwiches and drank juice box like soy milk. 

i am so excited for soy corndogs and juice boxes. 

i am tired of Russian and German spam. 

i am also tired of people who <a href="http://www.musicblogger.com">squat </a>on domains. at least when i squat i do something <a href="http://www.alliedmovements.com">interesting with them</a>. bastards!
