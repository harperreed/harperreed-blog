So awhile ago i was cruising the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/make/">make flickr tags</a> and i noticed the juicebox frame and i thought “i like frames. they are fun.” So i decided to go get some. unfortunantly they were all gone from walmat, or target so i went to the <a href="http://www.linux-hacker.net/cgi-bin/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowBoard&Board=MJB">linux-hacker boards</a> and found a dude who was selling some. I bought them right before it was <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/01/1651220">posted to slashdot</a>.

they arrived today.

So i immediately broke it apart. I barely had the batteries in before i destroyed the poor player. It looks to be a pretty cool device. The box itself runs <a href="http://www.elinux.org/wiki/JuiceBox">uClinux</a> and has a  2.75 inch 240x160 screen. The fact that it runs uClinux really makes the possible hackery cool. I would especially like to get shell on it and possibly create a fancy mini linux box. the uclinux link above details a jtag hookup. so i guess it is possible.

After i took it apart i dropped a bundle of pictures on the SD card and it worked. Pretty cool. now if i only haxored it all apart. mount it in a frame or something (<a href="http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000203045338/">this</a> is real cool) and moved the buttons to another place. i could really do something exciting with it.

here are some <strong>pictures</strong>:
