<p>So I haven't been updating as much as I should. I don't really know why. I have a LOT to blog about. In the past month - I have met some really cool people, attempted to learn python better, got and hacked a bunch with an OLPC. visited and gave a interesting tech talk to Google, hosted a CHIPY meeting and went to the mysql conf in Santa Clara. These are all things that deserve at least one entry if not more than one. </p> <p>I guess my excuse is that I am a slacker and have been busy. But busy with what?! I guess I don't know. I have been doing a lot of work from home - also working on side projects and hacking shit up. I read a lot of tech books right now and have been playing with IRC a bit more than I should. </p> <p>So starting right now. I am going to blog about my last month. I am going to break it up and blog in reverse chronological order. So I will start with the most recent and end at the mysql conference. Hopefully I won't give up before I am done. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:4e25c4cd-c876-4829-aba9-327ed0cc9096" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]blogging, stuff, slacker[/tags]</div>
