<p>2010 was a great year. I rarely write these retrospectives (only <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2009/01/04/2008-retrospectiv/'>2008</a> I think), but i think about writing them every year. It is so cheesey, but also a fun exercise in memory and retrospection.</p>

<p>So.. here goes.</p>

<p>2010 was a great year. I spent a bunch of time helping startups, hanging out with friends, spending time with Hiromi, traveling and enjoying life.</p>

<h1 id='work'>Work</h1>

<p>I spent most of 2010 doing my best to avoid deliverables and enjoy not having a day to day job.</p>

<p>I started out 2010 in San Antonio, TX hanging out with my friends at <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/'>Rackspace</a>. Rackspace is an awesome company and is powered by a great group of people. They are doing some neat stuff and are fighting a good fight. I am excited to see some of the stuff we talked about come to fruition. The coolest of those things is <a href='http://www.openstack.org/'>Open Stack</a> taking off. This changed everything in the cloud world. I finished my Rackspace gig in April. It was a great opportunity and hilarious to hang out in a <a href='http://www.zdnet.com/blog/green/rackspace-offers-a-unique-green-way-to-recycle-an-abandoned-mall/768'>mall</a>. I was also excited to have Rackspace <a href='https://www.cloudkick.com/acquisition-faq'>acquire</a> my friends at <a href='https://www.cloudkick.com/'>Cloudkick</a>. That was a great move. Congratulations to everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the Rackspace gig was over, I had nothing else planned. It allowed me to jump into my next plan. Learning about Startups, Venture Capital and the business of business. <strong>;)</strong></p>

<h1 id='startups'>Startups</h1>

<p>2010 also allowed me to further my interest in venture capital and startup funding.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time with <a href='https://sandboxindustries.com/'>Sandbox Industries</a>. They have a bunch of neat things going on and are succeeding in helping change the Chicago startup landscape. I am excited to see what 2011 brings fro <a href='http://bookyap.com/'>Bookyap</a>, <a href='https://lab42.com/'>Lab 42</a> and <a href='http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/'>Marbles: the Brain Store</a> and the other Sandbox startups.</p>

<p>I also had a chance to hang out with my friends at <a href='http://www.dfjmercury.com/'>DFJ Mercury</a>. <a href='http://www.dfjmercury.com/blair-garrou/'>Blair</a> and <a href='http://www.dfjmercury.com/aziz-ahmed-gilani/'>Aziz</a> are awesome. I also am super excited about my friends and DFJ portfolio companies <a href='http://infochimps.com/'>Infochimps</a> and <a href='http://graphic.ly/'>Graphicly</a>. 2011 is going to be awesome for them. I can&#8217;t wait to see this crew at SXSW 2011. It should be insane and fun.</p>

<p>Startup funding has changed quite a bit in 2010. I was lucky to be at the forefront of this change by being a Angel List scout. You can learn more about it on my <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/03/yes-i-am-a-venture-hacks-scout/'>scout blog post</a>. Interacting with Naval and Nivi has been awesome. They are great dudes who are changing the face of startup funding whether the industry wants it or not. It will be neat to see how 2011 turns out with early stage funding.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for Chicago to see the funding impact of Groupon&#8217;s success. It is really exciting to see my friends achieve so much and I am very excited for how this impacts Chicago in the next 5 years. My buddy <a href='http://twitter.com/leonc'>Leon Chism</a> wrote a <a href='http://leonc.tumblr.com/post/2071971732/chicago-mafias'>post on this topic awhile ago, I suggest you read it</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of startups in Chicago, 2010 was a record year for startup culture and execution for us Chicagoans. We saw the rise of Groupon, the <a href='https://groups.google.com/group/hn-chicago'>Chicago hacker news meetups</a> and a few <a href='http://startupmixology.techcocktail.com/2010-chicago/'>good conferences</a>. I am super exctied to see what this Chicago startup community achieves in 2011. Stay tuned.</p>

<h1 id='technology'>Technology</h1>

<p>In 2010 I launched a few neat applications. I soft launched <a href='http://www.ctaalerts.com/'>CTA Alerts</a> with Dan X. O&#8217;Neil - a aggregation of various alerts in the Chicago Transit system (with the coolest URL shortener - <a href='http://trn.st'>trn.st</a>).</p>

<p>I launched <a href='http://supertrackr.com'>Supertracker</a> - a really neat &#8220;track everything&#8221; via xmpp site powered by my friend <a href='https://twitter.com/julien51'>Julien&#8217;s</a> startup <a href='http://superfeedr.com'>Superfeedr.com</a>. SuperTrackr got a bunch of writeups and was doing crazy incoming <a href='http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/'>PuSH</a> traffic. All scaled magically by App Engine.</p>

<p>I also launched the hilarious <a href='http://ProximityCheckin.com'>ProximityCheckin.com</a> - a site that merges your Google Latitude location with foursquare checkins. Originally I wanted it to be automagic - but that is complicated. I am still experimenting with it and should have some progress shortly.</p>

<p>All of the above applications were weekend projects built on <a href='http://code.google.com/appengine/'>App Engine</a>. I enjoy App Engine and can&#8217;t wait to see what is next for that platform.</p>

<p>In 2010 I also got addicted to personal informatics. I got a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JE2PSA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002JE2PSA'>withings scale</a> and a fitbit and started tracking all sorts of things manically. I <a href='http://harperreed.org/informatics'>hooked it into my personal site</a> and made <a href='http://harperreed.org/informatics/steps/'>some</a> <a href='http://harperreed.org/informatics/weight/'>graphs</a>.</p>

<p>I also started tracking my location as well. You can see <a href='http://harperreed.org/where'>up-to-date location infomation on my personal site as well</a>. Including a <a href='http://harperreed.org/where/now'>relatively accurate real time display of my location</a>. I love Google latitude and am excited for all the things that can be powered by constantly updating location information.</p>

<p>I also scored a really neat award based on the work my buddy Dan X O&#8217;neil and I did on the CTA api. You can check out my <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/25/cta-hacking-unofficial-apis-and-winning-a-data-innovation-award/'>write-up</a> to learn more. I love the civic hacking.</p>

<p>2011 is going to be an amazing year for technology. My simple &#8220;2 word&#8221; predictions are: Cheap Android, More Javascript, Kindle Epub, more Nodejs, auto scaling, app engine, and minor AI. I am excited.</p>

<h1 id='personal'>Personal</h1>

<p>In 2010 we moved from lincoln square to wicker park.</p>

<p>We hung out in <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157625598388247/'>Japan</a> for a bunch of time and we spent a bunch of time in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeley,_Colorado'>Greeley, CO</a>. It was nice to spend some quality time with Hiromi&#8217;s family and my family.</p>

<p>My <a href='http://dylanreed.com'>brother</a> and I played <a href='http://minecraft.net/'>Minecraft</a> a bunch. It was a bit like when we played legos as kids. However, I was better sharing the pieces with Minecraft. <a href='http://harperreed.org/minecraft/'>Here is a map of our world</a> as of 01/01/2011.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of 2010 was hanging out with my amazing wife Hiromi. She is awesome!</p>

<p>I meant to post this months ago. hah. For some reason, it didn&#8217;t quite make it live. Then a couple days ago, I was talking to a friend about his recent move to Lincoln Square. We spent some time talking about great places to go eat and hang out, and I remembered this post. I thought I would get it up and out there.</p>

<p>A couple months ago, Hiromi and I moved from Lincoln Square to Wicker Park. We had wanted to live in Wicker Park for many years and since we have nothing keeping us in Lincoln Square - we decided to go ahead and move.</p>

<p>Lincoln Square was awesome.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed living there for the 3 years we were there. The neighborhood was awesome. The people were great. The nightlife was&#8230; well, there was a bunch of great restaurants. ;)</p>

<p>I wanted to take a minute to chronicle the places we went to a bunch and the places we liked. Hopefully this list will helpful to someone. These are all the places I will miss.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.jurysrestaurant.com/'>Jury’s</a> - This place is insane. It has great hamburgers, great food and great service. It also has one of the strangest crowds in Lincoln Square. Always makes me chuckle.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.drewseatery.com/'>Drew’s Eatery</a> - I like drew. He is nice. His eatery is a great place to get an afternoon snack or quick dinner. Very vegan friendly. This is key. They have Italian beef sandwiches. It isn’t often you can go to a vegan friendly place and order an Italian beef sandwich. I enjoy their water in a box.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.theglobepub.com/'>The Globe</a> - I think i went here 500 times for lunch with the SkinnyTech crew. It is a good place to watch people, football, rugby or have cheese fries.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.cafe28.org/'>Cafe28</a> - I love cafe 28. I suggest you go there immediately.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.adeliciousvegancafe.com/'>Delicious Cafe</a> - another vegan friendly place in the area. They have great vegan sandwiches and sweets. They often host dinners and other special vegan events. <em><a href='http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-leland-ave/2308/-rosded-restaurant?gl=us'>Rosded</a> - This is my favorite Thai place. It is cheap, good and small - as all thai places should be.</em></li>

<li><a href='http://www.costellosandwich.com/'>Costellos</a> - makes good sandwiches. We often walked there on an afternoon. It is always packed with families.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.halfacrebeer.com/'>Half Acre Brewery</a> - a recent addition to the neighborhood. It is a great way to grab a growler for a party or BYOB place. <em><a href='http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-montrose-ave/2030/-mythos-restaurant?hl=en&amp;gl=us'>Mythos</a> - Mythos is insane. I love every bit of it. If you are a fan of Greek foods and like BYOB then this place is for you. Mix it with some wine or the aforementioned Half Acre growler.</em></li>

<li><a href='http://www.glennsdiner.com/'>Glenn’s</a> - I think this is one of my favorite places in Lincoln Square. It is hilariously packed. Make a reservation.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.merzapothecary.com/'>Mertz</a> - this is for hiromi and hippies. They have nice soap.</li>

<li><a href='http://store.hazelchicago.com/'>Hazel</a> - A nice gift store/nick nack store. A great place for picking up gifts or party favors. I recommend it. We got many good items here. The people are always nice and they do gift wrapping.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.firstslice.org/'>First Slice cafe</a> - another great lunch spot. Out of the way. tasty and nice.</li>

<li><a href='http://chosunokrestaurant.com/'>Cho Sun Ok</a> - The insane people who went here took ALL of our parking spots, always. But for good reason. this is a great korean place.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&amp;near=Chicago&amp;dq=davis+theatre&amp;theater=davis'>Davis Theatre</a> - It is like a grindhouse theatre mixed with yuppies. A great place to see a cheap movie.</li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine I missed a bunch of great places. If you have any favs, leave them in the comments.</p>

<p>I really like Lincoln Square. I think we would live there again.</p>

<p>On October 28th, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Tech Cocktail Startup Mixology Conference. It was a fun quick conference with a set of amazing speakers.</p>

<p>Below is my talk. I spoke about fostering a community of problem solvers. Here are my <a href='https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dd3wvxq5_649fzcvqpvz&amp;interval=5&amp;autoStart=true'>slides</a>.</p>

<p>Would love to know your thoughts.</p>

<p>I am excited to see Tech Cocktail grow. I have been going to TC for years now. Threadless sponsored the first TC in boulder, we had tables at various TC&#8217;s in Chicago. Scott and I did a really amazing presentation on printers at the first TC conference. It has been awesome. I can&#8217;t wait to see what Frank has in store for TC next.</p>

<p>For awhile, nobody but us transit nerds paid attention to this api/hack. However, as more and more apps were built and more and more people used those apps - more people started noticing the benefits from the opening of this “api.”</p>

<p>The API got a number of really good write-ups, particularly about how the API was unofficial and how I went around hacking it. The first (and best) was by my good friend Dan X. O’neil: <a href='http://www.derivativeworks.com/2009/01/h.html'>&#8220;The power is not the mashup. It&#8217;s the data.&#8221;</a>. From here a bunch of really great posts popped up talking about the unofficial API and innovation. Joe Hughes blogged about whether the unofficial API is <a href='http://headwayblog.com/2008/12/14/unofficial-cta-apis/'>innovation on borrowed time</a>. Programmable Web <a href='http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/01/27/hacking-chicagos-unofficial-transit-api/'>summarized Dan’s piece and added some commentary</a>.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned post by Dan O&#8217;Neil, He talks about how we visited the CTA and chatted with them about the API. In the world of litigious organizations and scary governments - working with the CTA was awesome. They listened to what I did, asked really solid questions and then told us some of their plans. A lot of what we talked about ended up being included in their official API release. Dan’s brother Kevin O’Neil wrote this relationship and the results up on the CTA Tattler blog: <a href='http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/cta-tattler/2010/09/great-example-of-government-private-cooperation-harper-reed-wins-an-inaugural-mcic-data-innovation-award-for-chicago-transit-api.html'>Great example of government-private cooperation: Harper Reed wins award for CTA&#8217;s Bus Tracker API</a>.</p>

<p>Interacting with the CTA directly and working with them on their app was great. It really demonstrates how a private citizen can affect the mega government type organization to make things better for the future. I don’t think this is an easy pattern to replicate - but it is something to aspire to when hacking/proselytizing open data and open gov type APIs.</p>

<p>The most recent chapter in this story is that the <a href='http://blog.mcic.org/2010/09/mcic-project-prize-takes-a-turn/'>MCIC awarded me a Data Innovation Award</a>. I was sadly unable to participate in the award ceremony(I was drinking Chu-Hi in tokyo), but I hear it was awesome. Dan O’Neil was able to pick my award and say some words about what we did.</p>

<p>A lot of people helped make this happen. <a href='http://www.derivativeworks.com/'>Dan O’Neil</a> was an inspiration and really helped me figure out a strategy in working with the CTA. The CTA itself was awesome - especially <a href='http://coppoletta.net/'>Tony Coppoletta</a> and <a href='http://www.chicago-l.org/'>Graham Garfield</a>. Both of those dudes made it easy to work with the CTA and are also sweet guys outside of the CTA.</p>

<p>This has been a really good hack. ;) I am now a data innovator.</p>

<p>I am excited to be a part of Venture Hacks helping them find amazing startups for the <a href='http://angel.co'>Angels on the Angellist</a>. The scout program is going to be a lot of fun and hopefully will allow some great startups to be funded by the amazing angels from the angel list. Check out this <a href='http://gigaom.com/2010/08/31/angellist-designates-scouts-to-refer-new-startup-deals/'>great write up in GigaOm</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a startup that you want to submit to the angellist, you can do so yourself by <a href='http://angel.co/intro'>submitting directly to the angel list</a>. If you want more information about the angel list, or would like me to take a look at your startup (and get all the perks of interacting with a person as amazing as myself - hah) - then send an <a href='http://harperreed.org/contact'>email to me directly</a>. I am pretty easy to contact and can help out in many ways.</p>

<p>I am looking to help out and interact with midwest startups. I am very serious about making sure that Chicago continues to be a good place to be an entrepreneur. Having venturehack/angel list representation in Chicago will continue to help the community. Be sure an check out the <a href='http://angel.co/chicago'>listing for Chicago Angels</a>.</p>

<p>Making the Midwest/Chicago a great place for starting a company isn’t just for people like myself, the <a href='http://www.lightbank.com'>groupon guys</a>, <a href='http://www.sandboxindustries.com'>sandbox</a> and the angels. It is about the entrepreneur as well. Please let me know if you have ideas, concerns or just general insights into making the Midwest/Chicago the best place to start a company.</p>

<p>If you are outside of the Chicago/Midwest area - feel free to ping me anyway. I am always looking for new startups to talk to and people to connect.</p>
