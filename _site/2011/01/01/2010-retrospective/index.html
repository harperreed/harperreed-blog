  <p>2010 was a great year. I rarely write these retrospectives (only <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2009/01/04/2008-retrospectiv/">2008</a> I think), but i think about writing them every year. It is so cheesey, but also a fun exercise in memory and retrospection.</p>

<p>So.. here goes.</p>

<p>2010 was a great year. I spent a bunch of time helping startups, hanging out with friends, spending time with Hiromi, traveling and enjoying life.</p>

<h1>Work</h1>

<p>I spent most of 2010 doing my best to avoid deliverables and enjoy not having a day to day job.</p>

<p>I started out 2010 in San Antonio, TX hanging out with my friends at <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>. Rackspace is an awesome company and is powered by a great group of people. They are doing some neat stuff and are fighting a good fight. I am excited to see some of the stuff we talked about come to fruition. The coolest of those things is <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">Open Stack</a> taking off. This changed everything in the cloud world. I finished my Rackspace gig in April. It was a great opportunity and hilarious to hang out in a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/green/rackspace-offers-a-unique-green-way-to-recycle-an-abandoned-mall/768">mall</a>. I was also excited to have Rackspace <a href="https://www.cloudkick.com/acquisition-faq">acquire</a> my friends at <a href="https://www.cloudkick.com/">Cloudkick</a>. That was a great move. Congratulations to everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the Rackspace gig was over, I had nothing else planned. It allowed me to jump into my next plan. Learning about Startups, Venture Capital and the business of business. <strong>;)</strong></p>

<h1>Startups</h1>

<p>2010 also allowed me to further my interest in venture capital and startup funding.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time with <a href="https://sandboxindustries.com/">Sandbox Industries</a>. They have a bunch of neat things going on and are succeeding in helping change the Chicago startup landscape. I am excited to see what 2011 brings fro <a href="http://bookyap.com/">Bookyap</a>, <a href="https://lab42.com/">Lab 42</a> and <a href="http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/">Marbles: the Brain Store</a> and the other Sandbox startups.</p>

<p>I also had a chance to hang out with my friends at <a href="http://www.dfjmercury.com/">DFJ Mercury</a>. <a href="http://www.dfjmercury.com/blair-garrou/">Blair</a> and <a href="http://www.dfjmercury.com/aziz-ahmed-gilani/">Aziz</a> are awesome. I also am super excited about my friends and DFJ portfolio companies <a href="http://infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a> and <a href="http://graphic.ly/">Graphicly</a>. 2011 is going to be awesome for them. I can't wait to see this crew at SXSW 2011. It should be insane and fun.</p>

<p>Startup funding has changed quite a bit in 2010. I was lucky to be at the forefront of this change by being a Angel List scout. You can learn more about it on my <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/03/yes-i-am-a-venture-hacks-scout/">scout blog post</a>. Interacting with Naval and Nivi has been awesome. They are great dudes who are changing the face of startup funding whether the industry wants it or not.  It will be neat to see how 2011 turns out with early stage funding.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for Chicago to see the funding impact of Groupon's success. It is really exciting to see my friends achieve so much and I am very excited for how this impacts Chicago in the next 5 years. My buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/leonc">Leon Chism</a> wrote a <a href="http://leonc.tumblr.com/post/2071971732/chicago-mafias">post on this topic awhile ago, I suggest you read it</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of startups in Chicago, 2010 was a record year for startup culture and execution for us Chicagoans. We saw the rise of Groupon, the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/hn-chicago">Chicago hacker news meetups</a> and a few <a href="http://startupmixology.techcocktail.com/2010-chicago/">good conferences</a>. I am super exctied to see what this Chicago startup community achieves in 2011. Stay tuned.</p>

<h1>Technology</h1>

<p>In 2010 I launched a few neat applications. I soft launched <a href="http://www.ctaalerts.com/">CTA Alerts</a> with Dan X. O'Neil - a aggregation of various alerts in the Chicago Transit system (with the coolest URL shortener - <a href="http://trn.st">trn.st</a>).</p>

<p>I launched <a href="http://supertrackr.com">Supertracker</a> - a really neat "track everything" via xmpp site powered by my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/julien51">Julien's</a> startup <a href="http://superfeedr.com">Superfeedr.com</a>. SuperTrackr got a bunch of writeups and was doing crazy incoming <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PuSH</a> traffic. All scaled magically by App Engine.</p>

<p>I also launched the hilarious <a href="http://ProximityCheckin.com">ProximityCheckin.com</a> - a site that merges your Google Latitude location with foursquare checkins. Originally I wanted it to be automagic - but that is complicated. I am still experimenting with it and should have some progress shortly.</p>

<p>All of the above applications were weekend projects built on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>. I enjoy App Engine and can't wait to see what is next for that platform.</p>

<p>In 2010 I also got addicted to personal informatics. I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JE2PSA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002JE2PSA">withings scale</a> and a fitbit and started tracking all sorts of things manically. I <a href="http://harperreed.org/informatics">hooked it into my personal site</a> and made <a href="http://harperreed.org/informatics/steps/">some</a> <a href="http://harperreed.org/informatics/weight/">graphs</a>.</p>

<p>I also started tracking my location as well. You can see <a href="http://harperreed.org/where">up-to-date location infomation on my personal site as well</a>. Including a <a href="http://harperreed.org/where/now">relatively accurate real time display of my location</a>. I love Google latitude and am excited for all the things that can be powered by constantly updating location information.</p>

<p>I also scored a really neat award based on the work my buddy Dan X O'neil and I did on the CTA api. You can check out my <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/25/cta-hacking-unofficial-apis-and-winning-a-data-innovation-award/">write-up</a> to learn more. I love the civic hacking.</p>

<p>2011 is going to be an amazing year for technology. My simple "2 word" predictions are: Cheap Android, More Javascript, Kindle Epub, more Nodejs, auto scaling, app engine, and minor AI. I am excited.</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>

<p>In 2010 we moved from lincoln square to wicker park.</p>

<p>We hung out in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157625598388247/">Japan</a> for a bunch of time and we spent  a bunch of time in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeley,_Colorado">Greeley, CO</a>. It was nice to spend some quality time with Hiromi's family and my family.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://dylanreed.com">brother</a> and I played <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> a bunch. It was a bit like when we played legos as kids. However, I was better sharing the pieces with Minecraft. <a href="http://harperreed.org/minecraft/">Here is a map of our world</a> as of 01/01/2011.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of 2010 was hanging out with my amazing wife Hiromi. She is awesome!</p>

<p>It was a great year and was awesome. Things were low key and everything was wonderful.</p>
