<p>The iPad is a new and very exciting paradigm for computing. I played with it afternoon and it felt very minority report. It felt like the future. no physical keyboard. I was controlling things with my finger/mind. it was awesome. I am smitten.</p>

<p>Besides the irrational distortion field emitted by this shiny device, I have some general thoughts/complaints on the iPad. <ol>
	<li><strong>The lack of camera is irrational.</strong> I have no idea why apple didn't include two cameras on the iPad. It would be an amazing device for parents, students, people, etc. Chatting is annoying on non-multitasking devices, however it might be nice to Skype with a slate like device. It will obviously be added to the next iteration of this device.</li>
	<li><strong>The iWork cloud platform is annoying.</strong> Importing and exporting documents is very hard. It is obviously not meant to be used by people who have documents already. The only way to get shit on the device is to download it. Why wouldn't Apple integrate iWork with MobileMe? silly. Google will have to change their Docs platform to allow easy downloading from the mobile google docs page.</li>
	<li><strong>The lack of any clock or alarm app very strange.</strong> I use the clock app on the iphone for a lot of stuff. not having that is a bummer. but in the grand scheme of bummers its about a 0.00001/5.</li>
	<li><strong>There is no usb host mode</strong> (that i know of). I would love to charge my phone, etc via USB with this device. it would minimize the number of cables and what not i would bring. It would also be awesome to plugin external disks or keyboards to it.</li>
	<li><strong>Google Reader blows on the iPad.</strong> This is a real bummer since that is pretty much the one thing i want to have all the time. You can't scroll with the desktop version and the mobile version seems silly on the iPad. I can't wait for Google to "fix" all of their webapps for the iPad.</li>
	<li><strong>Using an iPhone after spending a lot of time on the iPad makes the iPhone seem like a midget</strong>. It makes the nexus one seems like it is made out of paper.</li>
	<li><strong>The iPad is probably one of the coolest ways to show presentations to someone while sitting at a bar.</strong> I have been pitching some ideas to people and having the iPad with my deck is pretty awesome. A great way to go over your presentation with one or two people. Way better than a laptop.</li>
	<li><strong>The Kindle app is awesome</strong>. I like it a lot. I want to try reading a book on the iPad, but i really like the kindle's screen.</li>
	<li><strong>Most of the apps are boring.</strong> Seriously. The apps that are impressive are: Kayak, Maps, Photos, Kindle, Twitterrific, instapaper, Netflix and Square</li>
	<li><strong><a href='https://squareup.com/'>Square</a> is one of the coolest apps I have seen.</strong> It should blow peoples minds. I imagine that it will be a game changer for friends who do retail. I can't wait for my square card reader to show up. I will be charging my friends for everything.</li>
	<li><strong>This is an amazing device for casual internet use.</strong> I imagine that Hiromi, my parents, my brother and anyone else who isn't attached to a computer all day long would love these devices.</li>
</ol> Overall the iPad is amazing. I can&#8217;t wait to see how developers iterate on the platform and create really nifty applications. It will also be fun to see what features Apple magically unlocks on the iPad.</p>

<p>I am going to try and build some applications now. If you have ideas - let me know.</p>

                <blockquote>I wrote most of this entry the day before the earthquake in Haiti. It was motivated by the magicJack announcement and my interest in mobile devices within developing nations.  However, the thoughts in this post suddenly seemed more real after I started hearing reports of communication breakdown after the earthquake.</blockquote><strong>The femtocell</strong>
<p>At the recent CES, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagicJack'>magicJack company</a> announced that they wanted to release a consumer grade FemtoCell device as an upgrade to their USB FXO/Softphone device.  Note: magicJack is an insane company. You probably have seen them on television commercials while watching USA &#8216;Up All Night&#8217;.  While these commercials almost seem scam-like, they have apparently sold 5 million USB magicJacks.  That&#8217;s a lot of phone calls!</p>

<p>A femtocell device is basically a mini GSM/CDMA tower. Think of it as a wi-fi AP but instead of wi-fi - it is GSM. You could drop it into your house, plug it into the Internet, and suddenly get 5 bars of connectivity on your mobile handset - instead of the standard AT&#38;T 1 bar. magicJack is offering the same service the USB dongle provides (unlimited calling and what not), but for mobile phones.  As a consumer, you would need to configure your handset to use the magicJack femtocell to receive/send calls.  When you are in range of the device (w/ signal strength enough to cover ~3000 sq. ft. house), you would bypass your carrier and use the magicJack for all incoming and outgoing calls. AWESOME.  Especially with the likes of Google Voice.</p>

<p>There are questions on the legality of such a device - but it is apparently legal to use inside your residence.</p>

<p>Side note: <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=magicjack+sip'>Magicjack is SIP</a>. And <a href='http://magicjackhacks.com/'>hackable</a>. There is a cat and mouse game being played out trying to unlock it.  You can even use it with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)'>Asterisk</a>.</p>
<strong>The thoughts</strong>
<p>So I began to think.  Femtocells could be used to open up mobile VOIP.  One scenario is that you could jump on a 3rd party carrier for a limited time to make a p2p VOIP call using your current GSM/WCDMA mobile device.  That is really awesome.  More importantly, what&#8217;s REALLY awesome is the pirate (3rd party) carriers.</p>

<p>Imagine purchasing 100 <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2010/01/17/i-love-phones-designed-for-developing-countries/'>Motorola F3</a>&#8217;s, a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnu_radio'>GNU Radio USRP2</a> (~$1400) running the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBTS'>OpenBTS stack</a> and a super huge antenna - and suddenly becoming a rural/developing country mobile provider. Or - if you&#8217;re more interested in being a pirate carrier - you could run this setup in a city and be a carrier for the dark side (drugs, gangs, nerds&#8230;). This inexpensive setup is available (and achievable) today!  In case of the apocalypse/disaster/camping/nerdcamp - I think it would be nice to have a set up to deploy to organize/help people.</p>

<p>My mind started to work into overtime.  I began thinking about the ramifications of hacking the magicJack. Wouldn&#8217;t it be neat to use femtocell technology to distribute ad hoc mobile carriers around a neighborhood/disaster area/rural/developing country?  You could hook the magicJack femtocell up to a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FON#Fonera_2.0n'>Fon2 device (usb/linux/broadband)</a> and distribute them around in places with connectivity. All you would need is a better antenna and some software to manage the provisioning and device identification. BAM! Instant pirate P2P GSM carrier.</p>

<p>I am hoping that this type of convergence will lead us <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/'>to the future</a>.</p>

                <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/4283555038/' title='Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3 by nata2, on Flickr'><img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4283555038_a798542c5f_m.jpg' height='218' align='right' alt='Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3' width='240' /></a>
<p>I love mobile phones. I don&#8217;t know why - but mobile devices represent so much of what I love about technology. The ubiquity, the fascination, all the new technology that pops up and all the different way people use their devices. I also feel like mobile devices will be the future of whatever the internet turns out to be. They will power the internet. With all this in mind - I have started to become interested in the devices that fill the opposite niche. The devices that are SO simple that their are almost NO features.</p>

<p>These are not Razrs, or other shitty mobile devices which act like they have all sorts of amazing features.  These specific phones are single feature, cheap devices and are often deployed in developing countries.</p>

<p>There are two that I really enjoy and I suggest checking out.</p>

<p>The first is the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100'>Nokia 1100</a>. Also known as my favorite phone in the world. I first saw this phone while working for <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594078282161/'>a minute in Bangalore</a>. It was advertised as a phone &#8221;<a href='http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4358'>made for india</a>&#8221; and apparently was hardy enough to be used by the working class there. I was drawn to the device. I neeeeeded it. It&#8217;s weird, because at the time I was running a symbian device that supported about every possible feature available in mobile - so thinking about jumping to a mobile device that was pretty much featureless was crazy. But - I was compelled.</p>

<p>The phone isn&#8217;t that fancy. It has very few features. It is super tiny and is super cheap. It is just a basic, simple phone that does nothing more than look &#8220;Nokia&#8221; and probably makes calls. The features it has are incredibly handy: flashlight, alarm clock and sms messaging.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize it then, but the Nokia 1100 is possibly the most popular electronic device in the world. According to the infallible wikipedia: Nokia has sold ~200 million of the Nokia 1100s since it&#8217;s launch in 2003. To put it in perspective - there have been ~30MM iPhones sold and ~50MM Razrs sold.</p>

<p>I eventually got a couple of these and used them as lenders, experiments and generaly fucking around phones. I even sent one to my brother for him to use - which he eventually washed in a washing machine - it still boots. They are HARDY. and 20 bucks.</p>

<p>The second phone that I am interested in is a bit newer and is a bit more tech. The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_FONE_F3'>Motorola F3</a>. My buddy <a href='http://thinkmoreinc.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/50-2/'>Hemmant showed it to me</a>, told me a bit about the history and I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it. Anecdotally, this phone was made by a Motorola team in india - again for use in the developing countries market. It is simple, has no features (even less than the 1100) and is JUST a phone. There is one major differentiator. The Motorola f3 is one of the only phones to have an e-ink display. This means that it uses very little power in standby (standby time of ~17 days), can be used in low light/no light situations and is rather resilient. The phone didn&#8217;t sell as many as the Nokia 1100 - in fact it was a veritable failure.</p>

<p>The F3 has no features. It barely send txt messages. It has voice prompts for all menus. It is just a phone. A user serviceable, easy to charge, thin, e-ink phone. It works well making calls and receiving txt messages. The F3 would be an amazing phone for a child, elderly person or someone who doesn&#8217;t want to deal with learning pesky features. I got one for my &#8220;go bag&#8221; as an emergency phone (I am not a survivalist, I just crush a lot).</p>

<p>You can find an unlocked <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A7KMW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013A7KMW'>Motorola f3 for about 30 bucks on amazon</a>. I suggest you get one.</p>

<p>I guess I will go ahead and jump in. This is based on what I use and would most likely suggest if we were drinking beers and talking about hosting. Your mileage may vary. I am sorry if I end up causing a nuclear war based on these recommendations.</p>
<strong>"Platforms"</strong>
<p>Two platforms are really getting me going these days. Google&#8217;s App Engine and Heroku.</p>

<p>App Engine is known by my close friends as my true love (haha. second only to <a href='http://hiromiusagi.com'>my lovely wife</a>). I spend almost 90% of my development time hacking on App Engine apps (<a href='http://Excla.im'>Excla.im</a>, <a href='http://CityPayments.org'>CityPayments</a>, <a href='http://ChicagoAlerts.org'>ChicagoAlerts</a>, <a href='http://chicagowiki.transitapi.com/'>Transitapi</a>, <a href='http://AwesomeUpdater.com'>AwesomeUpdater</a>, and <a href='http://harpersfriends.com'>Harper's Friends</a>). App Engine does a few things very well and allows the developer to do the rest. Quite a few of the lessons I learned while scaling out Threadless are baked into the app by default. You don&#8217;t have to scale all the pieces independently and you can really take care of things all at once. I recommend it and use it for prototyping and building new apps.</p>
<a href='http://Heroku.com'>Heroku</a>
<p>If you are interested in <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com'>Django</a>, Ruby/Rails or JVM languages (I am looking at you <a href='http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1831'>Scala</a>!) - I highly recommend App Engine or Heroku.</p>
<strong>"Cloud" Server Providers</strong>
<p>Cloud Servers are amazing things. Usually they are <a href='http://xen.org/'>XEN</a> hosted and wrapped by an API or a nice pretty interface. I &#60;3 them. If I would have had these server options in 2001 I would have been able to make the server kingdom I dreamt about. It would be awesome. Luckily, now in 2009/2010 I can build my server kingdom in the <a href='http://www.nepholologist.com/'>CLOUDS</a>. Anyway&#8230;.</p>

I recommend you <a href='http://www.linode.com/?r=1762fce92f905a07a8623481199299b3ab8a90b9'>take a look</a> at them and see if they will work for you.</p>

<p>If you do find yourself in the dark world of cloud servers, you should check out my favorite utility for managing all things servers: <a href='https://www.cloudkick.com/'>CloudKick</a>. CloudKick is a pretty solid app that allows you manage your all your Rackspace and Amazon servers. You can do it very easily and with very few buttons (I love a small amount of buttons).</p>

<p>If you are looking for awesome easy servers - use Rackspace Cloud Servers. If you are looking for a full stack (load balancer, block storage and what not) - use Amazon. I use Rackspace Cloud Servers.</p>
<strong>File Hosting and Serving.</strong>
<p>File hosting is simple stuff. I follow this simple guideline:</p>

<p>If you want to host a file for everyone (i.e. a popular image, a iso, download etc) where performance is important - use <a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files'>Rackspace Cloud Files</a> with limelight integration. This is the closest you will come to paying for enterprise CDN capabilities for a tiny amount of money. You can&#8217;t beat the level of performance that <a href='http://www.limelightnetworks.com/'>limelight</a> offers (unless you want to pay for <a href='http://www.akamai.com'>Akamai</a>).</p>

<p>If you need to put a BUNDLE of files somewhere that needs to be public or private - use Cloud Files or <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a>. Depending entirely on what vendor you like or what API you are most familiar with. I use both for backing up various data from my servers and home (I recommend <a href='http://www.s3rsync.com/'>s3sync</a>, <a href='http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/'>s3fs</a> for S3 or <a href='http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/mossofs.html'>MossoFS</a>, <a href='http://blog.chmouel.com/2009/09/02/rsync-like-backup-to-rackspace-cloud-file-with-duplicity/'>CloudFiles/Duplicity</a> for Cloud Files).</p>
<strong>Multi Tenant/Shared Hosting.</strong>
<p>Shared hosting is such a pain in the ass. ;) I really don&#8217;t like it. However, I use it because of the price and because of how easy it is to host stuff for friends and others.</p>

<p>I use two providers regularly for shared hosting:</p>
<a href='http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=harper'>Webfaction</a><a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/sites'>Rackspace Cloud Sites</a>
<p>If file storage is just what you need - then check out <a href='http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159982'>Dreamhost</a>. For the love of god they have cheap prices. I looked today and they were offering unlimited everything (that doesn&#8217;t make sense). The only problem is that they don&#8217;t allow you to use it as a backup service (y<a href='http://www.labnol.org/internet/backup-files-on-dreamhost-web-hosting-servers/4538/'>ou have to use the space in a very specific way</a>).</p>
<strong>Enterprise/Physical Servers.</strong>
<p>Enterprise servers are easy. You use <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/'>Rackspace</a>. ;) Seriously though - while at <a href='http://threadless.com/'>Threadless</a>, Rackspace saved our asses more than once. Using Rackspace allowed us to concentrate on our application rather than concentrate on our servers. Although they can be expensive - they offer so much that it is often worth it.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something a bit cheaper or a bit more hands on, I suggest my favorite chicago hosting company: <a href='http://fdcservers.net/'>FDCServers.net</a>. They offer great support and cheap servers. You are not going to get near the support that Rackspace offers, but you are going to pay a LOT less. I host a couple big apps at FDC and have had no problems at all.</p>
<strong>Conclusion.</strong>
<p>This wraps up my hosting review. I recommend App Engine, Cloud Servers, Cloudfiles/S3 and Rackspace Managed hosting. heh. See - super easy. All your hosting questions are answered.</p>

<p>2010 is going to be an exciting year. I imagine that Rackspace and Amazon will continue to fight head to head. Which will only make us consumers have better options. I also am very excited to see what Google does with App Engine (I imagine that they will NOT be adding <a href='http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=13'>PHP support</a>). I hope that 2010 is as productive as 2009 was for hosting, if so - then it will be an exciting, innovative time.</p>

<p>Leave your questions in the comments - I will attempt to answer them the best i can.</p>

<p>It was super hard to leave a job that taught me so much, helped me grow and was staffed by all of my friends, but I needed to make that leap towards the future. (<a href='http://siliconangle.net/ver2/2009/09/29/exclusive-interview-threadless-cto-harper-reed-heads-to-rackspace-whats-a-nepholologist/' title='here is a nice interview' id='c8k2'>Here is a nice interview</a> covering all sorts of aspects of my leaving.)</p>

<p>I did it, and the future is looking bright.</p>

<p>In the next few months, I am going to be <a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/blog/2009/09/30/the-rackspace-cloud-welcomes-harper-reed-nephologist/' title='helping Rackspace in their cloud computing division' id='vnml'>helping Rackspace in their cloud computing division</a>. My official title is <a href='http://nepholologist.com/'>Nepholologist</a>; a person who studies clouds. I will also be working hard to launch a startup (secrets secrets).  This is extremely exciting.  I&#8217;ll be spending half my day working with amazing technologists at Rackspace and the other half pursuing my own thing.   Rackspace has been amazing.  They&#8217;ve accommodated my want for freedom and the ability to concentrate on my own stuff while helping them out.  It will definitely be the best part-time job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

<p>I plan on detoxing.  I&#8217;ll be cleansing my brain of all the assumptions that I formed while at Threadless and ready myself for the startup life.  I want to be more scrappy and lean in my thinking.  Part of the plan is to complete all the various projects that I&#8217;ve worked on throughout the years like <a href='http://citypayments.org/'>citypayments.org</a>, <a href='http://excla.im/'>excla.im</a>, <a href='http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/12/exclaim-track-track-twitter-search-terms-over-im-in-near-real-time/'>exclaim tracking</a>, and <a href='http://harpersfriends.com/'>harpersfriends</a>.  I&#8217;ve done a lot of fun hacks in the last few years, and I want to work on making them much more robust.  This will allow me closure on one chapter of my life - while some doors close, new ones are opening.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who was supportive of me in this time. I could never have made this decision without the support of my family and friends.  To my lovely wife Hiromi, who was constantly telling me to pull the trigger.  My friends and coworkers who knew something was up - but dealt with me until the end - even when I was flighty.  My parents who helped me think rationally.  Most importantly, the entire Threadless family.  Without Threadless and the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained from my experiences there, I would not have the opportunities I have today.  The last four years have been utterly amazing (and awesome).</p>

<p>I have a couple of posts lined up for later this week.  One about my history at Threadless and another about the hijinks that have existed over the last few years.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.  It&#8217;s only just beginning.</p>

<p>I read a lot. I am not like those crazy people who read a book a day or anything, but i have been reading up to about 2 books a week for the past few years. They are not crazy books, mostly science fiction and fantasy, but they are not small books. I read to chill out. My day pattern is to go to work, work, get home, nap, hang out with hiromi, play computer and then read until i fall alseep. The reading part is VERY important to get my mind and body to a place where I can actually sleep. Needless to say, I take my reading seriously.</p>

<p>I ordered an original Kindle way back when they first came out. I was back-ordered for quite awhile. It was enough time for me to question whether or not I would like the device. Luckily, my friend <a href='http://edithfrost.com/'>edith</a> was also in the same place - she and i chatted incessantly about what the future would be like with the Kindle. It was a bright future.</p>

<p>I ended up getting it around mid january 08. The first book I read was <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAH3A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000PAAH3A'>Terror by Dan Simmons</a>. That is a serious business book. I had started the hardcover of the book earlier in the month and finished it on the kindle. That was my test. It was successful. Although i hated the fact that kindle pages and paper pages don&#8217;t really line up - the experience was the same. I was able to read fast and was able to forget about the buttons and terrible design of the kindle (like <a href='http://twitter.com/zachklein/status/1192280043'>Zach Klein said</a> - it looked like the consumer electronics version of the Pontiac Aztec).</p>

<p>After Terror, I read the appropriate <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBJCKI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FBJCKI'>Diamond Age by Neal Stephenon</a>. I felt that I was closer to the &#8220;Young Lady&#8217;s Illustrated Primer&#8221; than I had been before. I was reading books on an electronic device that was hardy, easy to use and quick. I was able to give it a seemingly unlimited amount of content and could use it for quite some time without a battery change. Like I said above - it is awesome.</p>

<p>Around this time I discovered the dark and scary underworld that is ebooks on the internet. There is an <a href='http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Main_Page'>awesome community of people surrounding ebooks</a>. They are involved with liberating DRM&#8217;d ebooks, converting from one format to another, uploading mass libraries of free ebooks, cataloging ebooks, etc etc. It is awesome. If you are interested in free content - there is an almost unlimited amount of <a href='http://feedbooks.com/'>free</a> <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page'>content</a> that is compatible with the Kindle available online. There is also an unlimited amount of pirated books too. They are harder to find and I feel terrible when I find them (I apparently would rather pay authors than musicians. hah). One thing i noticed while I was experimenting with ebooks - technical manuals and what not don&#8217;t render as well as non-technical books. I think it has to do with the number of diagrams and tables. They don&#8217;t render terribly - but often are not nearly accurate to what i imagine the author intended.</p>

<p>How you get the ebooks to the kindle is part of the magic. The kindle has what Amazon like to call the whispernet. It is, as far as i can tell, a sprint EVDO modem built into the device. Amazon uses this to wirelessly deliver content to your kindle that you buy from amazon.com. Once again - it is awesome. You click on a book in amazon and BAM - its on your kindle. You are not limited to using this JUST for amazon&#8217;s content. You can do it with your own ebooks as well. All you need to do is register your email address with amazon and then send books to the yourname@kindle.com email address. The books will appear on your kindle for a small cost ($0.10 i think). If you don&#8217;t want ot pay for it, you can send the content to yourname@free.kindle.com and it will return the book in the kindle format. You can do this .txt, .pdf and .doc files easily.</p>

<p>The kindle file format is just the .<a href='http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/MOBI'>MOBI ebook format</a>. Which in turn similar to the .PRC ebook format. The Mobi file is a remnant from the Palm days. it is basically the <a href='http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PDB'>Palm Database format </a>that was used for various applications on the original palm platform. What this means is that all the ebooks that end in .mobi and .prc are natively compatible with the kindle. If you had purchased books for use with the mobipocket reader (an awesome ebook reader for windows), there is a good chance that they were .mobi files. You can copy those to the documents folder of your kindle (when you plug it in to your computer via USB) and they will show up in the book list without any work. This really opens up your options for cheap or free ebooks.</p>

<p>The trick then is to figure out how to convert pdf files and what not to well formed, well meta data&#8217;d .mobi files. This makes your kindle happy and allows you to continue to sort by author without having your email address be listed as the author.</p>

<p>I went a year reading just the Kindle. I read two paper books that were not available in a digital format during this time. It was interesting. I felt as though I needed to work out to lift the heavy hardcover books. The kindle makes you forget how heavy books can be. My arms are now wusses.</p>

<p>When the Kindle 2 was announced, i ordered two of them. One for me and one for Hiromi.</p>

<p>The kindle 2 is a huge improvement on the Kindle 1. It is thinner, better performing and a bit easier to use. It is not as easy to turn a page - but it is also not as easy to accidentally turn a page either. I like the new design. The optional leather case is amazing. It works VERY well. i was having to remove the leather case from the original when I would read it - i don&#8217;t have that problem with the new one.</p>

<p>There are a lot of small software tweaks that have trickled their way to the Kindle 1 as well. They are separating out your uploaded content from the content that came from directly Amazon. I am also having a hard time finding things that are lost on the kindle. I suppose i could search - but i never think of that when I am looking for content. The interface on the Kindle 2 is much faster. The pages turn faster and the books load faster. The screen is amazing. I really like it. I don&#8217;t like the fact that I can&#8217;t easily turn off the wireless with a hardware switch. I liked being able to not interrupt my reading to turn wireless on or off.</p>

<p>All in all - the Kindle 2 is a huge improvment over the Kindle 1. If you are able to upgrade, do it. And then give your original kindle to someone close to you who wants one. That is the best plan.</p>

<p>Hiromi loves hers. I was worried that she wouldn&#8217;t like it - but it turns out that it works very well for her. She likes the size and the ease of use. She took to it very quickly.</p>

<p>When I got my kindle 2 I was showing a couple of my coworkers some of the data about it. Specifically the <a href='http://www.macworld.com/article/138728/2009/02/whispersync.html'>whispersync</a> stuff. I told them that I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they released an iPhone app that allowed ebook reading on the Kindle. I based this on the success of the Stanza app. I stated to my buddies that I was only confused as to the strategy to release such an app, especially on how it could accidently stifle the Kindle 2 sales.</p>

<p>Then a couple days later the Kindle app was released. Like the Kindle - it is awesome. hah. With the Kindle app for the iphone and the Kindle, you are able to sync your placemarks on the books you are reading. You could read to a certain point in a novel while on your commute - then go to a meeting and pick up your iphone and continue reading from where you left off on your kindle. Then you coudl pick up the kindle and it would sync to where you left off on the iphone. That is cool. I tried it and it works. It is a bit wonky - but for the most part it works great. The only issue i have with the app is that it doesn&#8217;t have ANY of the content that you upload via email. It is only amazon purchased content. Lame. I read a lot of &#8220;found&#8221; books and a lot of purchased books. An example is a series of books where 2-4 are in the amazon kindle store, but book 1 isn&#8217;t. I find book 1 elsewhere and then buy 2-4. However, I can&#8217;t read book 1 on my iphone. Only the kindle. WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO. ;) I understand amazon&#8217;s reasoning for this - and I don&#8217;t expect it to change. I do wish i could push my emailed books into their cloud and handle them a bit better (with metadata, etc). I doubt that will happen.</p>

<p>If you read a lot and want a great reading experience, you should <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00154JDAI'>buy a kindle.</a></p>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>I built <a href='http://excla.im'>Excla.im</a> quite awhile ago, well before <a href='http://twitter.com/harper'>Twitter</a> unleased their oauth beta program. Regardless, <a href='http://factoryjoe.com/blog/'>Chris Messina</a> <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/2841257703/'>tagged the Excla.im sign up process as an anty pattern</a> within his flickr stream. I was bummed because i would have loved to use Oauth to authenticate Excla.im. But because of the tagging, i was constantly thinking about how to remove the anti pattern.</p>

<p>Finally, Twitter released the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/42486bd3d7d136d0/f0e89b742bf0033e?pli=1'>Oauth Beta</a> and I was able to bribe @<a href='http://al3x.net/'>Al3x</a> to give me access (which reminds me, i need to send my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/3149040948/'>bribe</a>). I then sat for a month looking at the various python examples for OAuth and basically said &#8220;What The Fuck&#8221; over and over again. There were no solid examples and my experience with OAuth in PHP was a total hack so i could post shit to fireeagle. I was SOL as to finding a guide.</p>

<p>Then <a href='http://abrah.am'>abrah.am</a> released his <a href='http://github.com/poseurtech/twitteroauth/tree/master)'>PHP twitter OAuth lib</a>. It worked really well and was pretty much just plug and play to use it in a PHP app. Nice. I wanted that but in python. I decided to spend a minute or two and create it.</p>

<p>The base library my client is using is the the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/source/browse/trunk/src/gdata/#gdata/oauth'>OAuth lib</a> from <span style='text-decoration: none; color: #000000;'>google <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/'>gdata-python-client</a></span><a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/'> project</a>. I figure it is a working client and is in production use - so it should be solid. There are very few <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/source/browse/trunk/src/gdata/oauth/CHANGES.txt'>changes</a> between it and the official client that is released through <a href='http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/oauth/'>oauth.net</a>.</p>

<p>The client is rather simple, in fact it should work with other api providers with very little work. You can check it out at <a href='http://github.com/harperreed/twitteroauth-python/'>github</a>. Please let me know feedback. i am a python n00b - so give me your best shot/code review. I am using Google Code as a <a href='http://code.google.com/p/twitteroauth-python/issues/list'>issue tracker</a>, so feel free to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/twitteroauth-python/issues/entry'>post some bugs</a>.</p>

<p>It is rather pluggable. I was able to launch excla.im (on app engine) with oauth support in no time. I am currently not holding passwords for anyone. It is an awesome feeling.</p>

                <p style='clear: both'>I was tagged by both <a href='http://eliw.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/seven-things/'>Eli White</a> and <a href='http://flinglog.com/text/seven-things/'>Brian Fling</a> in this dastardly meme regarding 7 things. I am usually a HUGE fan of all things meme - and kind of regard myself as a <a href='http://fukung.net'>certified</a> meme expert. However this whole meme that requires a lot of work - I.E. blogging is something entirely different. I think i actually like it, but i am not entirely sure yet ;).</p><p style='clear: both'>I do find it hilarious that almost every blog post regarding this seven things starts with a bit of self deprecation and surprise at how this meme stumbled upon innocent them. Well, it did come as a surprise - so I guess i understand.</p><p style='clear: both'>Well here it goes. Seven things about me:</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>One:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I grew up without a TV. When I was quite young (~3) my parents got rid of their TV. I am not completely sure why. I imagine it had something to do with money (the lack of) and priorities being making sure my brother and I were clothed and fed. My parents got their first TV after getting rid of the previous one when I was about 21. My parents used to rent a TV for big events (war, olympics, etc) and my brother and I would watch the TV manically until it was returned to the rental place. We also used to rent a TV and VCR about once or twice a year to watch all the movies we could in the time alloted. Those were awesome times. I currently don't have a TV.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Two:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I have been paid to YoYo and Juggle in front of a LOT of people. I guess that makes me a professional. Heh. In college my two best buddies (<a href='http://therats.org'>Matiss</a> and Brian) and myself started a "circus" group. We juggled and did shows for all sorts of things. We opened for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus_(band)'>Incubus</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Mix_A_Lot'>Sir Mix A Lot</a>, and a few other boring bands. We protest juggled as a group called Jugglers against homophobia - protesting people like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Dole'>Elizabeth Dole</a> and her homophobic antics. After college I continued to support my friends by juggling on the side. It was a really fun time. I don't juggle as much as i would like, but i still try to make it to conventions and what not. It is a lot of fun.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Three:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>My first computer was an Apple ][c. My dad got it in some trade. My brother and I would build text games in basic. Shortly after that I got in to BBSs. Mostly we called places like <a href='http://www.totse.com/'>&amp;totse</a> and downloaded things that would get me in trouble. It was an awesome time. I suggest checking out the <a href='http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/'>BBS Documentary</a> to get an idea of how awesome it actually was.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Four:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I met my lovely wife <a href='http://hiromiusagi.com'>Hiromi</a> while in college in iowa. We moved to Chicago together in 2001 to live together as roommates. Eventually, it became clear that our relationship was much more than that. We got married in 2006 and happily live in Chicago. She is awesome.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Five:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I read a lot. I always have. Growing up without a TV will do that to a person. I read mostly fiction, but will stray to the dark side and read non-fiction every once and awhile. I usually read about an hour before going to bed. It helps calm me down and is a good way for me to get into the sleeping groove. I have recently been into ebooks and use a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B000FI73MA'>Amazon Kindle</a> to read them. I find that I do miss regularly reading paper books, but the convenience of reading ebooks is awesome. I can't wait until the eInk displays and associated readers are smaller, easier to use and cheaper.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Six:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I love David Bowie. It isn't a love that requires posters and discussion or anything. It is kind of similar to how people who grew up catholic talk about religion. David Bowie has just always been there for me. My first record I picked for myself was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars'>Ziggy Stardust</a>. My first concert was the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_and_Vision_Tour'>Bowie's Sound + Vision tour</a>. When I was quite younger, my mom took me to get my hair cut and I brought along my <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(film)'>Labyrinth</a> LP to show the stylist that I wanted <a href='http://thefanboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/david_bowie_labyrinth.jpg'>David Bowie hair</a>. I ended up with a rat tail.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Seven:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>Although I always knew I would end up with a Computer Science degree - I fought it as long as I could. In college I studied the history of Catholicism for a couple years before actually jumping into computer science. It was awesome. I ended up concentrating on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno'>Giordano Bruno</a> and the his (untimely) multi-world theory. It was a lot of fun and lead me to have an unnatural interest in the mechanics of theology.</p><ol style='clear: both' /><p style='clear: both'><strong>That's it!</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>To make this official, I now have to tag 7 people to make a Seven Things list on their blog.</p><p style='clear: both'>Ready? These Seven People please report to the meme office and make a Seven Things entry on your blog:</p><ol style='clear: both'>

                <p>2008 was a great year.</p>

<p>A lot of fun things happened. I started speaking more. I started using linux as my desktop. Obama won. I played with XMPP manically. I built some neat applications and Threadless continued to be awesome.</p>

<p>On my blog, the following entires got a decent amount of attention: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/10/06/chicago-transit-api/'>Chicago Transit API</a> - Oct. 6th - Reverse engineered and built a proxy for the CTA Bustracker.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/08/30/mini-hi-fi-the-chase/'>Mini Hi Fi: The Chase</a> - Aug. 30th - Built a mini stereo. Audiophile addiction avoided!</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/07/13/exclaim-a-replacement-jabber-bot/'>Excla.im - a replacement jabber bot</a> - Jul. 13th - Built a small jabber bot to update twitter.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/03/25/social-xmpp/'>Social XMPP</a> - Mar. 25th - Initiated a conversation with the venerable Peter St. Andre to start up the social xmpp list.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/03/02/olpc-chicago-jabber-server/'>OLPC Chicago Jabber Server</a> - Mar. 2nd - Built a jabber server for hosting various OLPC related community activities.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/03/02/awesome-hosting-options/'>Awesome Hosting Options</a> - Mar. 2nd - Outlined what I use for hosting. A rather popular post. A bit outdated. I need to update it.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/02/29/the-mosso-cloud-how-requests-are-not-a-good-metric/'>The Mosso Cloud: Requests are not a good metric</a> - Feb. 29th - I was unhappy with how mosso had set about charging us for usage. Mosso is still a good host and is still struggling with this issue.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/02/25/google-apps-auth-xmpp-and-radius-idea/'>Google Apps Auth: XMPP and Radius idea</a> - Feb. 25th - I wrote about how I wanted a radius endpoint for my google apps account. It would make a bunch of stuff easier for me. My solution was to hack a radius server to auth over our Google Apps talk/XMPP account.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/01/22/putting-the-blame-on-your-vendors-for-the-win/'>Putting the blame on your vendors for the win</a>. - Jan. 22nd - I was unhappy with how some internet peers had blamed their vendor when equipment failures resulted in downtime. I think that people should stand behind their decisions and if there is an error - they should take responsibilities. It is weak to blame a vendor.</li>
</ul> The theme seemed to be XMPP and Hosting - which, if you have hung out with me recently,  is rather close to what i like to talk about in real life ;). I think that I will continue this trend into 2009, but hopefully blog about it more.</p>

<p>I did notice that I ended up blogging less this year than almost any year before (2008: 30 entries, 2007: 84 entries, 2006: 154 entries, 2005: 166 entries, 2004: 275 entries, 2003: 290 entries, 2002: 266 entries, 2001: 103 entries, 2000: 27 entries). I have been blogging for about 8 years for a total of about 1395 entries - which means that this 1 year accounts for about ~2% of my blog entries. haha. I am guessing that 2% accounts for about 90% of my blog traffic. I am not a new years resolution type of guy, but I would like to blog more regularly. Hopefully get my percentage up a bit. maybe 100 posts. It isn&#8217;t THAT hard. ;)</p>

<p>To offset the lack of blogging, I twittered a lot. In fact, I updated twitter around 3251 times (this number is approximate because of the twitter api and paging). Of the 3251 tweets, 852 were replies. I replied to <a href='http://twitter.com/paulsmith'>paulsmith</a> the most with 25 replies. <a href='http://twitter.com/ryankanno'>ryankanno</a> was second with 20 replies. I said awesome around 249 times. I talked about sleep 71 times. I mentioned Hiromi 122 times. I said fuck about 46 times. I talked about work 238 times.  My fake new years resolution about twitter is to stop having twitter steal blog entries. I saw that written somewhere and I laughed at how often that happens. I think of a blog and instead just twitter about it. It kills the entry and doesn&#8217;t flesh out my thoughts as much. I think the best plan is to integrate and use both mediums to develop a post.</p>

<p>My flickr usage dropped significantly this year. Kind of a bummer because i LOVE taking pictures. Hiromi is currently telling me that we don&#8217;t take enough picture together.  It looks like i took only ~800 pictures in 2008. I blame this on the iPhone and how slow its camera is. In previous years i have used <a href='http://shozu.com'>shozu</a> and a 360 device. This let me upload picture directly after i took them and most often in the background. I need to take more pictures. I wish i had more insight into my flickr pictures. I need to build out my archive a bit more to keep track of everything like i did with twitter. It is quite handy.</p>

<p>Work was awesome in 2008. We had some large projects that launched a bit rougher than i would have liked, but they turned out awesome. <a href='http://typetees.com'>Typetees.com</a>, <a href='http://theselectseries.com'>theselectseries.com</a>, <a href='http://threadlesskids.com'>threadlesskids.com</a> and the new <a href='http://threadless.com'>threadless.com</a> are all awesome. The team that worked on them are all amazing. I couldn&#8217;t ask for a better team of technologists, production people, operations people and warehouse people to help make technology at Threadless be awesome.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what is in the pipeline for 2009.</p>

<p>Seriously - 2008 was a great year. I can&#8217;t wait to see what 2009 brings. I hope more fun, more blog entires, more tweets and more pictures.</p>

<p>I have been busy.

Hiromi made an amazing dinner and we ate it. ;) It was a great time. We missed <a href='http://dylanreed.com'>Dylan</a> and <a href='http://photodork.org/'>Sarah</a>, but we will hopefully see them soon.</p>

<p>This year has been great thus far and I will attempt to memorialize it in a year end post around the 1st. However, in the meantime I wanted to take a moment and say &#8221;<a href='http://www.threadless.com/product/509/HI'>HI</a>&#8221; and go ahead and wish everyone a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings'>Happy Holidays</a>.

<p>Although, I certainly don&#8217;t update my blog quite as often as I would like (or my mom would like) - I do update my <a href='http://twitter.com/harper'>twitter status</a> quite often and post a <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo'>number of pictures to flickr</a>.

                <p>I have recently been involved in talking to a local chicago entity about their unofficial API. It has been fun and deserves a blog entry of its own. However, this is not that blog entry - this blog entry is about mashups and the not so public APIs they often create.</p>

<p>In the past couple years i have constantly been tearing apart webapps. Either because I wearing my developer hat at work or because i am rocking on something at home. I have always been trying to figure out what goes on behind the scenes and wondering if i coudl use that to do something cool.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago i decided to figure out what powered the CTA Bustracker Google Maps mash up and was able to expose the <a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/'>"hidden" api that powered the mashup</a>. In a conversation I had with <a href='http://www.juggernautco.com/about.html'><span style='font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: x-small;'>Dan x O'Neil</span></a> about the unofficial API I was able to expose - he asked a question about mashups and APIs. It led me to rant about how there is so much untapped APIs out on the internet currently powering mashups, and other rich internet appliances. These APIs are not documented, are unofficial and will of course change. But think of the data and functionality that could come from all these mashups and startups who are building an API for internal use but could release it and empower their users to build something neat.</p>

<p>If you have built an application recently that has endpoints that is returning JSON for js frontend work, or is integrating with google maps, or is exposing endpoints for fun - PLEASE, please document it a bit, throw an API link on your site and let some enterprising and bored nerds build something on the thing you made. Don&#8217;t try to imagine how someone would use your endpoints - but expect to be surprised.</p>

<p>I need to do this with threadless - we built it to be very easy to break down and integrate into other peoples sites (image urls, etc). But, there is a secret API that we should be releasing, documenting and letting people use. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>The genesis for this API is some work I did awhile ago reverse engineering the <a href='http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/map/displaymap.jsp'>CTA Bus Tracker mashup</a>. I was able to expose the endpoints that powered their google maps mashup. In its original state - you can get some pretty awesome functionality and data. I am attempting to clean it up and make it more robust.</p>

<p>The native endpoints thus far are: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getRoutePoints.jsp?route=49'>getRoutePoints</a>: Returns latitude/longitude, stop IDs, and stop names for bus stops along a particular route.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getPatternPoints.jsp?route=20&amp;pattern=959'>getPatternPoints</a>:</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getStopPredictions.jsp?stop=8207&amp;route=49'>getStopPredictions</a>: Gets stop predictions. Timing and whatnot.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getBusPredictions.jsp?bus=6654'>getBusPredictions</a>: Returns arrival predictions for a particular bus.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getBusesForRoute.jsp?route=49'>getBusesForRoute</a>: Gets buses for specific route</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getBusesForRouteAll.jsp'>getBusesForRouteAll</a>: Gets information about every bus in the system.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/schedules.jsp?agency=1&amp;route=92'>Schedule</a>: Download the Schedule (pdf! w00t)</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getTimeAndTemp.jsp'>getTimeAndTemp</a>: Outputs the current time and temp</li>
</ul> I have created a proxy for the endpoints that will do some caching and hopefully alleviate any crazy load the CTA servers would have if this API becomes popular.</p>

<p>I also did some work to push the UPOC alerts from the CTA riders community into a usable form. That endpoint is the first of hopefully many that can be used to grab real time information about the CTA. You can access it at: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/api/alerts/upoc/latest/'>Community Upoc alerts</a>: Outputs the last alert sent from the UPOC group</li>
</ul> Dan X O&#8217;Neil and myself hacked these alerts into the <a href='http://twitter.com/ctatweet'>CTA Tweet bot</a> that sends CTA updates via twitter. Pretty neat.</p>

<p>Moving forward with the API, I want to do a couple key things. The first is to return JSON instead of that terrible XML. The second is to create a couple endpoints that will help with finding the right bus at the right location. I am always looking for help with this stuff - so if you have any ideas - please let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>So far, there are not a whole lot of applications using this API. The only ones I have thus far are: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://commuting.in/chicago/about'>Commuting.in Chicago</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://txtful.com/template.html?templateId=1368034'>txtful bus alerts</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://businfo.chicagobus.org/'>ChicagoBus.org Bus Finder</a></li>
</ul> If you know of any others - let me know. I have a couple projects brewing myself that will hopefully add a shortcode, and a jabber bot for bus notifications and queries. Are there any things yall would like to see? I personally want a really solid native iphone app. It would be awesome to be able to have the iphone pinpoint your location and then tell you what the nearest buses are that are arriving soon. Also - replicating the bus tracker in an easier to use fashion would be excellent.</p>

<p>All of this API work wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the help of <a href='http://detour1999.com'>Dylan Richard</a>, <a href='http://www.derivativeworks.com/'>Dan X O'Neil</a> and <a href='http://chicagobus.org'>Kevin Zolkiewicz</a>. The CTA has also been amazingly cool with all of this - I really like those guys.</p>

<p>The trip was hilarious from the get go. On a Thursday, we flew into Phoenix via SouthWest. That airline is a <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=southwest+sucks'>clusterfuck</a>. I am not a fan. However, it is much better when we have &#8220;Business Class&#8221; tickets - which apparently means we get a drink ticket to dull the pain, and get to board a bit earlier than the others. It was a mess of annoying drunk middle aged women on a group trip, children and indignant and entitled business men who thought they were all that. We owned them all. Once we landed, we rented a <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/2372164187/'>very stupid car</a>, and then drove the neat/boring drive to Tucson. Once we got to Tucson, we wrote our presentation (luckily <a href='http://callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a> has spent countless hours creating legitimate slides for us slackers to pilfer) and got on our way.</p>

<p>We had some awesome Mexican Food. Went to a couple hilarious bars, met some cool people, and ended up at a lesbian bar. It was pretty different than our times in chicago. ;) The night life in Tucson, near the college, is full of college kids. Weird. Being around so many young people was invigorating. And annoying. haha. GOD I am so old. OMG.</p>

<p>The next day we went to the event and spoke. It went over well. We got some good feedback. Like: don&#8217;t swear as much, don&#8217;t put up Obama 2008 slides and practice before we actually do it. I thought that was decent feedback. I think if we did it again the only thing I wouldn&#8217;t change is the Obama slide, and it seem that was the most offensive. Apparently, you are not supposed to be political at all on a college campus. I wonder when this happened? It certainly wasn&#8217;t like this when I was in college. Maybe at a &#8220;conservative&#8221; business school, things are different. Regardless, if I were to speak there again - and the political climate is the same as it is now, I would put the same slide up.</p>

<p>The other people we spoke with were amazing. Particularly Robert V. Kozinets. This dude is awesome. He has written extensively about <a href='http://kozinets.net/archives/97'>tribes on the internets</a> and <a href='http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/2003/03_news_sum4.html'>burning man</a>. I imagine that you have read about him before (even if you didn&#8217;t notice). We ended up hanging out with him quite a bit. Another person who uses words I have never heard to describe things that we do everyday. I am particularly interested in his work on Burning Man. I guess I will have to read it.</p>

<p>After all the festivities of the event were over, we chilled on the streets of Tucson, and eventually met up some of the staff of the Eller College of Management for dinner. The dinner was great, but even more great was meeting <a href='http://www.drsidneyjlevy.com/'>Sidney Levy</a>. Sidney is apparently one of the people who <a href='http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=IB95hkJczk4C&amp;dq=sidney+levy&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fRR2Nkl7id&amp;sig=7XQtrnSG0b-MaKDq1g4xXxbBDsQ#PPP1,M1'>developed the world of brand marketing</a>. He was billed as the father of symbolic marketing. This is serious business. However, he was very much not serious business. He was awesome. Charlie and I hung out with him for about an hour, just talking about life, love and all things that occur between. Sidney was quite funny and had a lot to tell us. I am going to attempt to help him get his gullibility project going. Excitement.</p>

<p>Speaking is pretty awesome. I learned a lot from talking to the people around us. It was awesome to hang out with young people who are excited about something that I am not excited about. Inspiring and hope giving. I hope that Charlie and I get to do it again. Hopefully in Hawaii, or maybe Guam, or possibly some other paradisiacal place.</p>

                <p>Last week my friend <a href='http://mark.atwood.name'>Mark</a> pinged me and mentioned that I should get together with a friend of his who was in town for PYCON. I am always into meeting new people so I had dinner with <a href='http://dorseys.org/'>Brian Dorsey</a>. It was awesome. I was able to rant and rave about all my ideas, interests and whatnot with new and possibly interested. Brian immediately suggested that he introduce me to a friend of his who he thought I would enjoy talking to. So I was introduced to <a href='http://anders.conbere.org/journal/'>Anders Conbere</a>. The reason Brian thought we should meet was that we both incessantly talk about XMPP.</p>

<p>Anders and I talked for a couple hours Friday, and found that we had a lot of similar ideas and thoughts about XMPP and its place in the world of social software, communities and data. Anders explained that we weren&#8217;t the only crazies who thought that XMPP should be used for more than instant messaging. He mentioned that <a href='http://stpeter.im/'>some</a> <a href='http://romeda.org/'>cool</a> <a href='http://www.hackdiary.com/'>kids</a> were also looking into the relationship of XMPP and social software. As Anders was dashing out the door to his flight, we decided that we needed to create or at least foster the growth of a mailing list to collect people.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Anders introduced me to <a href='http://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a> who is the Executive Director of the XMPP Standards Foundation. We chatted a bit and then came to the conclusion that there needed to be a place for people to talk about their ideas, uses, experiences and what not. And thus <a href='mailto:social@xmpp.org'>social@xmpp.org</a> was <a href='https://stpeter.im/?p=2177'>born as the go to mailing list to discuss these topics</a>.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas and hopefully with the help of this group, I can flush them out and really tackle them. I am pretty excited about it.</p>

                <p>I am finally recovered from my flash travel/party tour. Being shuttled around the country going to parties is a rough life - let me tell you. It was awesome. I met some great people and saw some really cool stuff. It was really cool how much overlap occurred between the boulder crowd and SXSW. Startup people are fun. I want to run down the events and how they turned out. The first was boulder. <a href='http://www.keepboulderweird.org/'>Boulder is a weird place</a>. Seriously. It is strange. The boulder event was at this bar called the Foundry. I am guessing that if it wasn&#8217;t packed to the gills with tech people from the front range, I would never go there. It was a pretty hilarious venue, however the tech people really filled it out. So it turned out to be a great choice. In boulder there were a lot of cool startups presenting. The one that really caught my eye was <a href='http://socialthing.com'>Socialthing</a>. These guys are sweet. They are doing a very simple and elegant solution for the crowded social aggregation space. Although I really like the community features of their direct competitor <a href='http://friendfeed.com'>FriendFeed</a>, I like the design and interface of socialthing alot. It is great - and they are sweet guys. There were a fair number of other startups, but unless they have real words in their names - i won&#8217;t link them. Just kidding, but seriously - there were a fair number of people with startups that plain didn&#8217;t have the best names. It is a bummer. Especially because the people were so nice and their ideas/technology seemed solid. It is <a href='http://deliberately-different.blogspot.com/2006/02/how-they-named-companies.html'>hard to</a> <a href='http://www.salon.com/media/col/shal/1999/11/30/naming/print.html'>name a</a> <a href='http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/the_name_game.html'>company</a>. Anyway - some of the not so awesomely named but awesome technology and problem solution startups in boulder are: <blockquote><a href='http://Lijit.com'>Lijit.com</a> - doing search for your blog. kinda like google site search, but with your social graph built in. Really cool stuff. <a href='http://Villij.com'>Villij.com</a> - not my favorite name. The guys are cool and they have some cool ideas about recommendations in the social graph space.</blockquote> I also met a really awesome &#8220;startup enabler&#8221; named <a href='http://jeremytanner.com/'>Jeremy Tanner</a>. He seems to do what I do at Threadless for various startups in the Colorado scene. Jeremy moved from Detroit to Colorado - so he had a lot of input on how it was going from city to smaller city. He had great things to say about being able to jump on his motorcycle and head to the canyons for an awesome lunch time experience. After this event, I crashed at my hotel. Spent some time with my parents and was off to SXSW for ONE day! With much insanity, I finally made it to Austin and barely made it to the People Powered Powwow. It was awesome. Hearing the experiences of <a href='http://etsy.com'>Etsy</a>, <a href='http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/bagbuilder'>Timbuk2</a>, <a href='http://moo.com/'>Moo</a>, <a href='http://www.jpgmag.com/'>JPG</a> and all the other awesome companies was quite inspiring. It was also awesome to meet the people who are behind all these awesome brands. It was like a secret people powered club where we all tell our people powering secrets. A really powerful meetup. I am glad that <a href='http://richardmoross.com/'>Richard</a> (from moo) set it up. it alone was worth the trip. Some of the companies that were there that I really liked: <blockquote><a href='http://styleshake.com/user/'>Styleshake</a> - I was surprised by this one. Styleshake is a neat community that helps facilitate custom dresses. Another thing I would have never guessed would be made into a crowd sourcing enterprise - but it works. And it seems to work well. The dresses are cool and the variations are impressive. If I was a svelte young woman I would certainly check this out. <a href='http://www.burdastyle.com/'>BurdaStyle</a> - I thought this was the coolest idea i had heard in awhile. Open source sewing patterns. Taking various patterns and releasing the designs to the community to create and manipulate. Helping to foster the crafting, sewing world as well as create awesome clothes.</blockquote> After the mini conference, I was fortunate enough to have dinner with the JPG people and Wilson Minor (<a href='http://everyblock.com'>EveryBlock</a>). We ate at some nice Mexican food place. It was good, better than Chicago Mexican food. Then I made my way to the soon to be <a href='http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/430139/'>bumping party</a>. The party was fun. There were a lot of people. Floss seemed to be well accepted and it was awesome to meet <a href='http://www.kidkameleon.com/'>kid kameleon</a>. Around this time I had the awesomeness to bump into a dude from <a href='http://www.threadbanger.com/'>Threadbangers</a>. he was able to capture my <a href='http://www.threadbanger.com/episode/SXSW_20080310'>natural retardedness for an episode of threadbangers</a>. haha. Whew. After my debut in amazing, I was able to take a minute and meet up with some friends. It is fun to hang out with Chicago friends when not in Chicago. I met up with <a href='http://jacobdehart.com'>Jacob DeHart</a>, <a href='http://bloxes.com/'>Aza Raskin</a>, <a href='http://www.srobbin.com/'>Scott Robbin</a>, <a href='http://www.humanized.com/about/'>Andrew Wilson</a>. Another person I was thrilled to meet up with is <a href='http://mediadiet.net/'>Heath Row</a>. Heath has always been a favorite person of mine and it is great (and rare) to hang out in person. After the party died down - we all went to the <a href='http://PureVolume.com'>Pure Volume</a> ranch for the Social Thing party and my trip came full circle. I was able to meet up with the Lijit, Villij and Socialthing guys. After rocking out there for a couple hours i decided to head home, sleep and finally attempt to make my way back to Chicago. I barely made it. ;)</p>

                <p>This is exciting. Obama is the first candidate I have ever donated money too. Hopefully this will enable his campaign to get enough traction to win on a national level. Hopefully it is Obama and Huckabee against each other. Because then we either get Obama - who is pretty awesome, or Huckabee who is an insane person. INSANE. So either the U.S. will be in a place to repair, or a place to engage in a Holy war with the world.</p>

<p>Anyway. We just got back from japan. It was amazing. Everyone had a great time. Pictures are up on <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157603616549745/'>flickr</a>. I will blog about it later.</p>

                <p>Awhile ago i decided to switch to Linux on my laptop. It was awesome. I didn&#8217;t last however - a work emergency occurred and I spent more time getting the openvpn to work up and then getting the Cisco vpn to our servers going than solving the emergency problem. It was indicative that i should have eased into desktop Linux a bit more.</p>

<p>So I have with much sadness reinstalled windows on my primary laptop. Since i do so much of my work in Linux still - I just moved my Linux desktop home dir into vmware and rock it there.</p>

<p>Having to switch back made me really bummed. I wanted to use Linux full time. I use it constantly on servers and for coding, but I wanted to engage in it for everything. It is obviously very usable and compelling - but it just didn&#8217;t solve the problem I needed solved at that one very important point.</p>

<p>The good news is that I have another laptop that I use casually. It is a lot smaller and much more portable. And it is now my desktop Linux machine - so I haven&#8217;t given up totally. And it is a much more interesting test of the usability of desktop Linux - because Hiromi will also be using it while we travel.</p>

<p>So far - so good.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be able to figure out my VPN issues and move back to linux.</p>

                <p>This weekend, my family is going to Japan to hang out with Hiromi&#8217;s friends and family. It should be absolutely madness. I am very excited.</p>

<p>I like not having to deal with Jesus during the holidays. Its nice to be able to supplant tradition with something new and totally different. Like going to Japan.</p>

<p>The plan thus far is to hang out in Tokyo for a couple days and then make our way to Yamanashi for a party on the 28th. Then we will have New Years with Hiromi&#8217;s family and then head home.</p>

<p>It is going to be quite something I think. Look for pictures!</p>

                <p>Tonight, Scott and I presented at the Chicago Ignite tech meetup. It was pretty fun. The event was &#8220;eventful&#8221; and the people were the usual. I was able to meet up with trow and the hosted labs guys - so that was good. It is always fun to involve ourselves in these affinity events. This one was especially funny because it was at a good friends bar. So when we showed up - it was quite hilarious.</p>

<p>We were scheduled to present on smart choices in small IT. However, that didn&#8217;t really go as we had planned. We got as far as creating an initial presentation of the small IT ideas - but we didn&#8217;t feel right presenting something so dry at the end of this event. We thought that most of the people are gunna be a bit intoxicated and probably won&#8217;t care that skinnycorp uses google apps. (If you think you might care - i suggest you check out <a href='http://www.morefishthanman.com/2007/12/03/the-5-smartest-things-you-can-do-in-small-it-right-now/'>Scott's blog on the subject</a> - it is a culmination of our talks and the basic outline for our planned presentation. ) So with this in mind, we gave up on doing a serious presentation and decided to just rock out in our typical guerrilla humor way.</p>
<a href='http://docs.google.com/TeamPresent?docid=dd3wvxq5_43gq3g4x'>So here is our presentation</a>

                <p>Man. <a href='http://www.tuaw.com/2007/11/29/atandt-puts-the-kibosh-on-voice-free-iphone-plans-for-the-deaf/'>This</a> really gets my goat.</p>

<p>I have always had an interest in accessibility of technology by people who are differently abled, but i usually concentrated on seniors and children. It never occurred to me the challenges that a deaf person would have interacting with mobile phones and all that (I mean - i was aware that such challenges existed, i just never interacted directly with someone who had experience). About 6-8 months ago i met this guy <font size='3'>Brendan </font>at a conference. He had a sidekick, was deaf and was talking the shit out of some peeps on the sidekick. He showed me how he used an IPrelay to talk to peeps on phones. It was neat, impressive and probably an unexpected side effect of having such a message centric device.</p>

<p>We talked a bunch about how the sidekick + iprelay is awesome. And eventually we talked about the upcoming iphone release. He was super excited - because apple has been so friendly to the Deaf Community, and the promises of a messaging centric Apple handheld telecommunications device was quite alluring. The deaf community was abuzz with talk about the upcoming phone and whether or not it would break the reign of the sidekick as being the best device for deaf folks.</p>

<p>There was quite a bit of <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=169'>hype</a>, <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=100'>talk</a>, <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=113'>and</a> <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=112'>various</a> <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=109'>posts</a> on <a href='http://www.deafmac.org'>deafmac.org</a> about the iphone. This is where i started to pay attention. It was obvious that the deaf community was dealing with a different beast. Apple had closed the iphone - pretty much making it lamer than it had to be. They didn&#8217;t ship with a lot of the functionality that could have made it a dream machine for the deaf community. But people like Brenden kept at it - not giving up and dealing with the nuances of having an always on the web device.</p>

<p>One of the things i discovered while talking about all this nonesense is that the carriers usually offer a plan that is data/messaging centric with very little concentration on a voice for their deaf consumers. This seemed awesome. But AT&#38;T didn&#8217;t offer such a plan for the iphone. And now they are officially saying that they don&#8217;t plan on ever offering one. You can read more about this over at <a href='http://www.tuaw.com/2007/11/29/atandt-puts-the-kibosh-on-voice-free-iphone-plans-for-the-deaf/'>TUAW</a>.</p>

<p>It seemed that their reasoning was that &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t fair to the non deaf community.&#8221; How annoying. The Deaf users of the iPhone have to pay for a number of unused voice minutes that they probably won&#8217;t use just to get the messaging platform they need. AT&#38;T seems to think that the people who are using this data only plan are not the Deaf community members, but randoms who just want to use it as a internet device.</p>

<p>Well, shouldn&#8217;t this tell AT&#38;T something? I mean - instead of alienating a group of people who just want to use the iphone as it was meant to be used: a communicator - shouldn&#8217;t AT&#38;T realize (like tmobile did with the sidekick) that the iphone is more than a phone and that people WANT to use it however they want?</p>

<p>It just kills me when i hear stuff like this. AT&#38;T is at the top of the market. But i hope that moves like this reverberate through their consumers and drop them a bit. Especially with <a href='http://www.nypost.com/seven/11282007/business/verizons_open_door_331877.htm'>Verizon opening it's network</a> and <a href='http://code.google.com/android/'>Google's Andriod</a> - maybe consumers (and consumers with different needs) will be able to get a device which suits them and doesn&#8217;t cost them more than it should.</p>

                <p>I am a linux mad man recently. I was noticing today that almost all of my devices i enjoy using are unix and mostly linux based. Pretty insane. So with that thought i decided to unshackle myself from the man and attempt desktop linux for the first time.</p>

<p>I am scared. Hold me!</p>

<p>I am currently installing Ubuntu on my laptop. 7.04 didn&#8217;t boot on this guy - but 7.10 rocks pretty hard. So i am not yet disappointed. I am hoping that i will not need anything SUPER windowsy for awhile. And if I do - I am just going to install windows in either qemu or vmware. We shall see.</p>

<p>Honestly, I want a macbook.  I love OSX. I love the general usability, and the ease that everything works together. I love the app integration. I am absolutely in love with Address Book. I love making my contacts better and better. I hope to have EVERYONES email and phone. ;) But i don&#8217;t like how it obfuscates all the fun unixy parts. I wish it had a better package manager. I wish it was easier to dig into the trenches without getting into the darwin version of dll hell. But, I am not soo worried.</p>

<p>I  am addicted to debian&#8217;s package manager. From playing around on my fancy new ubuntu/debian servers to playing around with my various desktops i have played with. I have found the secret to linux. NEVER COMPILE ANYTHING. seriously. wth was i thinking back in 93. compiling all this shit all the time. that was bullshit. The new new is the way to be. I am dead serious. If i had a choice for running a server. it would be debian - based purely on the broad scope of packages that are in apt. And then if it isn&#8217;t in apt, i am easily able to find a .deb of the package. Rock. RPM&#8217;s can suck it (that&#8217;s right rackspace.. better watch out! I may change everything to debian at a moments notice!).</p>

<p>I love disto wars. Ma. I remember when Atkins and I were trying to decide whether to use slackware or yggdrasil linux. back in the day. we usually went with slackware. Then redhat came out and blew our minds. Then we didn&#8217;t care. until now!</p>

<p>Oh the struggle!</p>

<p>I am pretty happy that these are the worst things happening right now in my life. Which unix derivative to use for a desktop. ;) Rock On!</p>

                <p>Happy thanksgiving!</p>

<p>It has been a long and lazy day today. Pretty awesome. We are about to head out to a party at our friend Jill&#8217;s house. it should be fun. There were so many options this year. Quite a <a href='http://callmejeffrey.com/'>few</a> <a href='http://morefishthanman.com/'>people</a> offered to include us in their families thanksgiving - it was a hard decision. I just picked the first one. haha. (and hopefully the one with the best food - as the hosts are all chefs at various places around the city).</p>

<p>Friends are awesome.</p>

<p>We miss our families, but will see them soon.</p>

<p>So happy thanksgiving to everyone.</p>

                <p>For the first time in almost 7 years my servers are offline.</p>

<p>I just shut them down. It was pretty sad. They were good servers. They did a lot of traffic. They were slashdotted, dugg, reddited, and probably any other sited that was hot shit in the last 6 years.  I installed them when my dedicated host died in early 2001. Originally I just shipped them a box, which they hooked up. The original box was a VA Linux box from their fire sale. It owned. I paid 200 a month for unlimited transfer. At that time I was doing about 25G a day in transfer. heh. Then in 2003, I bought a bundle of hardware to upgrade my infrastructure and added a firewall, a super fast switch and another server. With all this fanciness I was able to pull an average of about 120G a day&#8230; for 3 years straight. Which I think is around 130 terabytes. I guess that is what i get for hosting shady content. ;)</p>

<p>So now I embark on a new style of hosting. A mix of hardware, shared and virtualized.  I have a box at <a href='http://leaseweb.com/'>leaseweb</a>, a demo box at <a href='http://mediatemple.net/'>mediatemple </a>(it is pretty dope), a bundle of stuff at <a href='http://mosso.com/'>mosso</a> and then a handful of sites sprinkled around ec2. It makes me sad to not have full control of my sites. I am bummed that mosso doesn&#8217;t offer SSH. I am worried that my hosting cocktail will not handle my needs and that I will be hit with crazy overages. I can&#8217;t afford a 10k hosting bill. that would be annoying.</p>

<p>When i think how this hosting plan is how most people host stuff, I can&#8217;t imagine their pain. Through managing my own boxes, I learned SO much. I fought hackers (both brazillian and korean). I fought lawsuits. I fought clients and users. I learned how to manage load, how to scale php, how to work out kinks in a cheap infrastructure and all the fun tricks that got me to my job at threadless. But most of all I learned that I really love linux and open source software.</p>

<p>I will miss you servers! Peaces!</p>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>Since Google just changed the game of mobile software - I got to thinking about my new fascination - Contact management. So the first place I go to is Gmail and <a href='http://lifehacker.com/software/sneak-preview/gmail-speeds-up-improves-contacts-316673.php'>Google's new contact manager</a>. Being an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISync'>iSync</a> freakout, I love syncing my contacts. I LOVE being able to bring in contacts from all my different sources and see them mix with my current contacts. I LOVE finding duplicates and merging then. God I am a dork. So recently, Google released a new contact manager into Gmail&#8217;s across the world (If you don&#8217;t have it, you probably will soon) - so I was excited to try out the import export pieces to see how well it works/goes. fun fun. here are most of my notes.</p>

<p>First off some history. So there is a pretty <a href='http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/01/gmail-contact-list-exposure.html'>well documented "hole" in the old Google contact manager available in Google video</a>. I say hole because some people claim its a security concern. It is. But I don&#8217;t think it is too big of concern. It requires a legit cookie and active session. I imagine through some reflection and other security nonsense - bad things could happen. But i am happy it is exposed.</p>

<p>If you go to: <blockquote><a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=PICKER&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Name&amp;max=300&amp;out=js&amp;rf=Emails&amp;jsx=true'>http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/ui/ContactManager? js=RAW&amp;maximize=true&amp;hide=true&amp;position=absolute&amp;hl=en&amp;border=NONE</a></blockquote> You will get a list of your contacts in XML. You can add various things onto the query string to change the output to js (<a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=ALL&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Name&amp;max=500&amp;out=js&amp;jsx=true'>out=js</a>), change the sort order (<a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=ALL&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Email&amp;max=500&amp;jsx=true'>psort=Email</a>, <a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=ALL&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Name&amp;max=500&amp;jsx=true'>psort=Name</a>) and I am sure there are others as well.</p>

<p>So from here we move onto Gmail and the new contact manager. First off, you can easily find the new xml/js stream of your contacts: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/data/contacts?show=ALL&amp;out=js'>http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/data/contacts?show=ALL&amp;out=js</a></blockquote> This is (apparently) all your contacts. Take away the &#8221;&#38;out=js&#8221; if you want to see the <a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/data/contacts?show=ALL'>easier to read XML version.</a></p>

<p>So now the magic part of it all! Access to the raw Contact Manager. You do not have to physically in Gmail to access it. Just visit this easy to remember URL: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/ui/ContactManager'>http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/ui/ContactManager</a></blockquote> You now have access to the new contact manager for Gmail (even if your Gmail account doesn&#8217;t have access). You can also access this from a Google Apps account as well: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/contacts/ui/ContactManager'>http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/contacts/ui/ContactManager</a>?</blockquote> Pretty easy!</p>

<p>From here you can handle all the goodness of importing and exporting your contacts to real formats. You can add real contact info. You can import from a bundle of different places and finally get your Gmail address book under control.</p>

<p>Sadly, there is not an &#8221;<a href='http://code.google.com/apis/gmail'>official</a>&#8221; Gdata rest API for Google contacts, however with the recent announcements and with <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/'>OpenSocial</a>, I can&#8217;t imagine it being far behind.</p>
<strong>Extra Credit: </strong><blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/email@address.com' title='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/email@address.com'>http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/email@address.com</a></blockquote>
<p>So the trick is to just append the email address to the url: <a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/' title='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/'>http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/</a></p>

<p>So for me you get: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/photos/harper@nata2.org'>http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/photos/harper@nata2.org</a></blockquote> That is the picture of me for my Google Apps account. If you want it in Gmail go to: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/harper@nata2.org'>http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/harper@nata2.org</a></blockquote> <font color='#40454b' style='background-color: #ffffff'>This is obvious a helper URL to easily get contact pictures in Gmail. You just replace the email address in the above URL with your own and you will get the picture. You could probably roll your own simple <a href='http://site.gravatar.com/'>Gravatar</a> like service using this info!</font></p>

                <p>I have been working at <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a> for about 2.4 years. We have grown a lot in that time. It is really cool to think about. When I started, we had 3 servers, a lot of traffic and were selling quite a few shirts a day. Now, we are approaching 40 servers, a veritable ass load of traffic and we are selling a lot of shirts. It has been awesome to be a part of growing the technology behind <a href='http://threadless.com'>Threadless</a> in a pace that matches the community.</p>

<p>It has been a great 2.4 years. So you can imagine how excited I was, when <a href='http://jakenickell.com'>Jake</a> and <a href='http://callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a> asked me if I wanted to be CTO of skinnyCorp. I smiled. Did a guitar kick. Said yes. and went back to work ;)</p>

<p>Part of my new position will be leading skinnyCorp and threadless to having a more public technology face. I hope to see more of you at conferences, and with luck, I will be able to talk about the cool stuff we are doing here at skinny.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see where we will go in the next couple months, years. It will be fun to grow Threadless to wherever our community takes us. And it will be awesome to be a part of whatever tricks we have up our sleeves in the coming months. Stay tuned for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>Btw, We are looking for a mysql rockstar. Someone who is bad-ass and doesn&#8217;t mind being called a DBA. So if you are that person (or know someone) - <a href='mailto:harperr+mysql@skinnycorp.com'>send me an email</a>.</p>

                <p>Pretty insane. <a href='http://torrentfreak.com/oinkcd-servers-raided-admin-arrested/'>Oink has been raided and the owner has been arrested</a>.</p>

<p>Oink was a really neat tracker. It was apparently fast, clean and super easy. Apparently it was the biggest private bittorrent tracker. Around 180k users. That is a lot of dedicated users.</p>

<p>It taught a bunch of people I know about bittorrent. It was used by anyone from joe smoe to actual musicians. It was a huge music community.</p>

<p>It is a bummer that it is gone. But I imagine something better will pop up shortly. What a sad day for music.</p>

                <p>Today I found out that my dad was placed into the hospital to help him fight his infidel skin. Basically he has what is colloquially known as &#8220;extreme eczema,&#8221; but basically it seems that his skin is attempting to hijack his body and run it into a building. So with that in mind, he went to get himself checked out.</p>

<p>During his check out, the doctor was like &#8220;OMG. Yours skin is at terror alert red. you need to check yourself in immediately. &#8221; and so he did.</p>

<p>Needless to say, my mom was pretty upset by this. My parents like each other (So strange in this day and age) and they don&#8217;t spend a lot of time apart. So my dad being away is hard. and now that he is away and in a hospital - it is a bit stressful.</p>

<p>She called and asked if I would come down with her. I wasn&#8217;t sure because i was supposed to go to this conference. So I checked around to see if any of my other siblings were able or near. I first called Dylan - but him being the only Reed left at the family company - he had to stay and hold down the fort. Apparently there were a bunch of fires he had to but out. So i called our brother from another mother - Jon. And this is where the story gets fun.</p>

<p>I call Jon and say &#8220;Jon, What are you up to.&#8221; Jon in his typical fashion tells me that he is just getting down from a redwood tree and is in California, but making his way to Portland. This is hilarious. I tell him the situation and he is pretty bummed, and can make it out on Thursday. So i tell him i will get back to him.</p>

<p>I then talk to my mom and mention that Jon is in some trees and can come out if she wants. So she tells me that I should &#8220;Tell him to stay in his tree.&#8221; Heh.</p>

<p>Damn hippies.</p>

<p>So anyway. I will be flying out to meet my mom and help support the family units for the next few days. Hopefully I will be able to get some awesome work done and explore the Hogwarts like world that is the hospital.</p>

                <p>Awhile ago I got this email from a friend. It is about the Medical Marijuana problem with Iraq veterans. I thought you guys might like to read it. So here it is: <blockquote>I just read the article you posted about medical marijuana and veterans and it definitely was intense. Its a shame that they are not getting taken care of. That particular guy says that there were no nightmares and his limbs were intact, which is very lucky. I have friends that came back from Iraq in the last year or so and it is scary to see the change. First off, only one of them has agreed to come out and interact with us again. My friend John is a Marine and was stationed mainly in Ramadi. John had always been an interesting character, but since Iraq he has lost all innocence. He's still very spontaneous and wacky, but in a very bitter way. He acts as he does because he's so angry that popped collars walk around thinking that they are kings, and John is not treated as a king coming back home. He won't talk about most of what happened over there, only few of the fonder memories. His best friend was basically blown up in front of him, leaving a wife and child in California. One particular weekend, John and I went to CU to visit my now ex. Very stressful nights that weekend. John got shit ass drunk as quickly as possible and yelled at everyone on the streets for being able to enjoy their 20 something years. We got kicked out of two bars in half an hour, then John decided to disappear for the rest of the night. He'd come back in one hour, two hour, three hour intervals and take off again. Talking to him on the ride there and back was ridiculously difficult. Making small talk was pointless, and talking about Iraq was too personal. Every time he came back home he pulled the same disappearing act, completely disregarding the fact that we were worried about him.It just broke my heart to see how badly he wished he was still naive. He was sent to Iraq for a second trip, and I have since lost contact with him or friends that would know where he was. That article totally hit a sore spot in my heart for these guys out there. In no way am I a supporter of the war or the military, but I completely support the individuals that decide to put themselves into the military. This line from the article, 'My wife was the love of my life, the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but when I came back from Iraq, she was now a complete stranger to me, as I was to her.' is an issue that most vets deal with, its really fucking sad.</blockquote> Yep. Its insane how the government is creating a state of war that most people don&#8217;t want, then not supporting the troops as much as they need to be supported. We need this to stop.</p>

                <p>So my <a href='http://jimknox.org'>grandfather</a> is older. He isn't 1000, nor is he 150. But he is up there. Maybe around 75ish. But he is pretty spry and active. He is, in fact, the mayor of his <a href='http://www.burlingtoncolo.com/'>town</a>. So the other day when I was in Colorado - he mentioned how he was needing to get his emails up, how he needed to be able to get and receive his important mayoral emails. Right after talking with my grandfather about email, my parents both got <a href='http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo700p/'>Treo 700p</a> phones from verizon. They are really nice, and have a really great embedded email client. So they were able to send email quickly and send text messages easily. This was much different than before when they were not able to do either without being in front of their email client. Now they were able to do both and with ease. It reminded me of when <a href='http://hirominakazawa.com'>Hiromi</a> explained how a lot of people who email each other in japan do it not on a computer but on their phones - and they may not know how to use a computer, but they can email anyone in the world just fine. </p>

                <p>I am glad to be back to work. I can&#8217;t wait to really hit work hard. i feel it coming soon. the work. i am pretty excited.</p>

<p>i am thinking about bulding an intranet haha. just a place to put rss feeds and the like of our various interweb resources.</p>

<p>anyway.. this weekend:</p>

<p>On friday after work i went with jeffrey to a small house warming party at robrob&#8217;s house. it ruled. i picked up a 1.5 firmare PSP for 200 with a couple games. What a deal. i really wanted one to haaxor and play homebrew on it. I grabbed it &#8211; went home. charged it up. and immediately played super mario 2 on it. Man i love emulators. i played Rtype and bomberman 94 on the way to work today. it rules. i was also able to play a bit with backups. Luckily all the ISO&#8217;s i found were of games i already owned (this was both lucky and a bane.. stupid isos). I am gunna need a bigger memory stick. my 512 is painfully full. I wonder if battery life is better if i run Twisted Metal: Head-On from the memory stick versus the UMD. I am excited to play against matiss at twisted metal in different room. i really can&#8217;t wait for socom. however i am worried that the game is going to suck.</p>

<p>anyway.. on friday i met up with Rani, Kira and the like to hang out at bars and such. Kira and i attempted to goto see &#8220;of montreal&#8221; with jeffrey - but were tricked by it being a popular show. so we went to lula and drank a bottle of wine and chilled. Then we went to Rainbo, then to victor hotel, then to redno and then to crobar. you know. a typical friday.</p>

<p>On saturday i slept in. worked a bit and played with my fancy psp. then met Rani, Kira and crew for Rani&#8217;s sorta birthday dinner at this nice Tapas resturant. it was pretty good. Then i went to Erica&#8217;s birthday party and then met everyone at rainbo. Then to tumans. then to a small party at Rani&#8217;s. I slept in and then went to rotofugi to get Rani a birthday present where i met my new PSP buddies. hah. it ruled. Then i went to Rani&#8217;s BBQ. it was quite fun.</p>

<p>After the BBQ i went home, took a nap, played Rtype and then got ready for my VOX night at spybar. Spybar, as usual, sucked. haha. it was ok. but lame. so we went to redno 5 and had a great time. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A09%3A05_Vox_party_at_spybar'>here are pictures</a>. then i had corn beef hash in the middle of the night - which almost killed me. KILLED I SAY!</p>

<p>So yesterday i just worked in front of the TV. i watched meet the fockers, LOTR: ROTK, and gremlins 2. I also got some ISO&#8217;s to boot. how i love torrents.</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/war/aaron_broussard.mov'>this is horribly sad</a>

                <p>seriously. new orleans got knocked the fuck down. It is amazing how nature can take a piece of something that we think is strong and then remove our conception of strength without even thinking of it. I remember reading the other day about how the hurricane had POUNDED miami and it was going to disrupt the VMAs (oh my god!!) - but no one had even an inkling of how powerful and destructive it could end up being. I guess we now know. I think it is insane that the governor of louisiana is saying that new orleans needs to be abandoned. i wonder if we will rebuild it - or if it will be under water. i heard that it is a city that is below sea level and near the mouth of a river and near a lake and near the ocean - that seems like a bad place for a city. eh.. i guess we all learn from our mistakes..</p>

<p>if you haven&#8217;t - you should donate money to the relief fund. IT IS IMPORTANT. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/philanthropy/red-cross.html/002-7291545-6512808'>go here to donate through amazon. </a> Please do this.</p>

<p>in other words.. today at <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a> we all hung out and worked (of course) - until jacob got his 6 nerf pistols. we then threw down some <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a> vs. <a href='http://threadless.com'>threadless</a> justice. it ruled. quite fun. I have fixed and built my new work computer - so tomorrow i will really start working. only took one week to get settled in. i guess i need some shelves and such to make things really nice. i gotta create a home for my homies. and for my yoyos</p>

<p>yea know. yoyos. i love them.</p>

<p>i need to fix my photolog. i will do that now.</p>

<p>so. i HATE movies that have uncomfortable situations.. seriously - along came polly, bottlerocket, and the like. the uncomfortableness makes me really uncomfortable. haha. so much so that i am pausing hitch and then fast forwarding it cuz i can&#8217;t deal with it. it grates on my nerves. but like a horror movie - its nice and fun to have those feelings. although it KILLS me. KILLS. i may have to stop watching and goto bed.</p>

                <p>i remembered that <a href='http://www.simple-answer.com/'>mark verbos</a> was playing his live set at smartbar (and by remember i mean greg told me). It was amazing. Verbos is quite something. i love distortion and hearing it build and seeing him do his little knob thing. haha. so good. i took <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F260820050159'>some pictures</a>. He has <a href='http://www.simple-answer.com/MarkVerbos_LiveAcid.mp3'>posted an MP3</a> of what he basically did tonight (albeit tonight was quite a bit harder). you should check it out.</p>

<p>who wants to buy me a 6680?</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t really want to right now.</p>

<p>i have a busy weekend ahead of me. i am excited for work tomorrow. and i am ready for work this weekend. jesus i am going to have a busy fall. but yea. i am excited.</p>

                <p>Seriously. so my chicago car plus card was deactivated cuz my credit card info was invalid and my company(or lack there of) stopped paying for my transit. SO i updated my credit card info, purchased a $75 dollar 30 day pass and called it good. they said to wait 3 days. i attempted - but apparently didn&#8217;t wait 3 solid days - so they deactivated my card again. wtf. so i ordered a new card and then called. The EVIL EVIL women on the phone told me that it was my fault that the card was deactivated cuz i didn&#8217;t wait the three days. however i sorta did wait three days and that was on the 18th. it is now the 26th and the card is deactivated again. so angry. i HATE when customer support people tell me i am wrong. especially when they accuse me of lieing. i am not so receptive of that.</p>

<p>argh. AND i am on hold. seriously. i am gunna punch them.</p>

<p>this summer has been interesting. i think i am at a point where i can talk about it. not emotionally or anything - but the nda&#8217;s are almost void. hah.</p>

<p>i am hungry. and rather tired.</p>

                <p>so i accidently broke my webserver. haha. well by accidently i mean i am in the process of moving all my important and not so important sites to my new webserver so in the process i broke it. it sucked. but now it is mostly back to normal. everything is pretty much the same except i am unable to officially do my photolog right now. but i still update the master &#8221;<a href='http://nata2.org/photolog.php?expand=1'>moblog</a>.&#8221; so check it out. <br /><br />work is weird right now. today i moved all my stuff from my cubical. like four boxes of crap i have collected - mostly nick nacks and such. it was nice to remove it but also sad. transition is totally hard. and i am in the thick of it. all i do is wonder. haha. but whatever. it will be a nice change. <br /><br />my laptop is totally fuxored up. the wireless doesn&#8217;t work with my router. it possibly could be my router. but maybe not. it has been flaky today. lame. <br /><br />i am kinda tired. today i inadvertently slept all after noon. i missed like two meetings i had with friends. it sucked. but i apparently needed the sleep. <br /><br />i am still reading my &#8220;dark japanese fiction.&#8221; today hiromi told me that try as i might i will never become japanese. i laughed. i am applying now to teach english in japan. haha. and i just purchased a bunch of anime. and i totally download asian porn all day. well those things are all not true - except for hiromi telling me that i am not japanese. anyway. yesterday i read kitchen by bana yoshimoto. it was so good. very very sad. but also nice and happy. i hate that my vocabulary causes me to describe books as nice. i wish i could actually use words that are appropriate rather than nice, good and like. someday i will be a real boy. i promise. <br /><br />ok now i am going to debug fopen and webpages on my new box. <br /><br />btw this is the new server. <br /><br />btw btw. it is still broken</p>

<p>I got my OGO in the mail today and have been using it on and off all day. It is a pretty cool device. Unfortunantly (as any new device) it has some pretty annoying bits to it. I will give a basic rundown of the features as i see them.</p>

<p>The OGO is basically a device meant to hit the market of kids who are texting, instant messaging and emailing a lot. the point between a two way and a sidekick. the back of the box says This is Ogo. It does IM, it does e-mail, it does text. All in one. All at once. Any time, any place - in your hand, on the bus, at the beach, at home, at large. You dont need a computer, you dont need a wire. You get the message. Send word. And welcome to the Ogosphere. omg. so that is the gest of it. hah.</p>
<!--more--><a /><a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2054.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2054.jpg' border='0' align='left' /></a>
<p>So i was contacted to be a tastemaker/tester for the OGO a couple weeks ago and i jumped at the opportunity. I received the box and immediately busted it open. The box is crazy colored and is obviously targetted towards youth (and possibly the sidekick market). it has an interesting pricing structure on the back of the box - 17.95, 1 account; 20.99, 2 account; and 23.99, 3 accounts. i have no idea what this means i can only imagine it has to do with the number of email accounts or aim accounts you associate with the device.</p>
<strong>Size:</strong>
<p>The device is very similar in size when closed to the gen 2 sidekick. and a bit bigger when opened:</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2027.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2027.jpg' border='0' /></a><a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2026.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2026.jpg' border='0' /></a><a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2028.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2028.jpg' border='0' /></a>
<p>Other devices:</p>

<p>Nokia 6600, Ipod, Ogo, Sidekick Gen 2, Blackberry 7280</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2023.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2023.jpg' border='0' /></a>

<p>Ogo, Sidekick, Blackberry 7280</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2031.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2031.jpg' border='0' /></a>
<p>Ogo, Yoyojam Hitman</p>
<strong>Thoughts:</strong>
<p>As you can see the Ogo is a competitive size. It is a bit bigger than the sidekick when folded out and a bit thinner when folded up. It is quite a bit bigger than the hitman. The size feels pretty good. it is weighted well so it rests in your hands well. It is pocket sized and the thinness is much more attractive to me (i.e. fits in a jean pocket).</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2040.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2040.jpg' border='0' align='left' /></a>
<p>The screen is very bright and has good resolution. I dont konw the specs but it looks <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2044.jpg'>very good</a>. The speaker is loud and clear. The feel of the device is pretty solid. Sometimes i find that i am immediately afraid i will break a device when i get it into my hands. this hasnt even crossed my mind with the ogo. i imagine that i coudl slam it into my back pocket and goto a club without a problem.</p>

<p>I got it to boot up without a problem and noticed right away that the OS is unique looking. It isnt as smooth as the sidekick and really demonstrates how functionally limited the device really is. There are tabs for mailbox, IM, Compose, Contacts, My status, Help, Settings and Device.</p>

<p>The mailbox is simply your email inbox. you can use either a AOL, MSN or yahoo mailbox - or better yet a pop mailbox. This is awesome. it appears(although i am probably mistaken) that the device itself checks the mail - unlike the sidekick which proxied the mail off to T-Mobiles servers. I appreciate this. I suppose i will verify this as my usage continues.</p>

<p>The IM functionality is pretty simple. I was disappointed that it wasnt as clean as the sidekick - although it is pretty dope. The keyboard integrates nicely and is rather usable. i do miss the scroll wheel thing on the sidekick though. One thing that really annoyed me, when entering a password it doesnt astericks out the characters until you are done entering the password. This seems like bad practice. and it makes me mad. haha. ANGRY. umm. so here are some pictures:</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2032.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2032.jpg' border='0' /></a>
<p>AIM Buddy List <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2033.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2033.jpg' border='0' /></a></p>

<p>AIM Conversation <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2039.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2039.jpg' border='0' /></a></p>

<p>Current Message Dialog</p>

<p>The sms functionality appears to be straight forward. I have yet to introduce the device to my friends. We shall see how it holds up when i am attempting to locate a party and what not. It is responsive and the ui is <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2035.jpg'>pretty</a> when receiving a message.</p>

<p>I have yet to be able to use or figure out how to use the PMG. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2056.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2056.jpg' border='0' align='right' /></a> As far as i can tell i am only able to pair it with my phone. I will have to read up on PMG and see what to do. heh. it does have a unique feature - rather than being able to choose if the bluetooth is visible - you can only turn the visibility on for 1 minute. This is both annoying and cool. no bluejacking. heh.</p>
<strong>Gripes:</strong>
<p>The sounds are really annoying. as far as i can tell there isnt a way to truely configure/customize the sounds. This means no ringtone market - no alt sound sets. etc. the default sounds are annoying and ithe level of granularity in the config is pretty bad. for instance, i am unable to say - notify me when a person messages me but that is all, or notify me when someone signs on but doesnt message me. etc. i wish they woudl just replicate the freedom of the AIM client and then roll it into profiles.</p>

<p>The second thing that annoys me is the lack of web browser. would i the that hard to include a web browser. haha. probably. it just seems that it would be handy and fun if it browse the web. a real sidekick killer.</p>

<p>the third is the fact that it uses AIMs mobile buddy list crap. so my buddy list (which is around 200 peeps) is cut off and modified for this device. And the buddy list displays everyone in order whether they are online or not. kinda lame.</p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>After using the thing for the afternoon i think i like it. there are some annoyances but over all it seems to be a lean mean chatting machine. (i am a dork) I wouldnt replace my sidekick with it - it doesnt have ssh and all that - but it fits into a very specific niche and seems to do rather well at it. I obviously need to figure out how to send my contacts to it and then figure out how to use PMG. when i do that i think i will like it a lot. It is also kinda big, but small when folded up. I may feel weird when i use it. i will have to see how the trainride home goes. ;) I will be experimenting with the USB port later (so far it just charges).</p>

<p>It feels very anime.</p>

<p>Check out all the pictures i took of it <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review'>here</a>.</p>

                <p>it has been a weird couple days. It all started last wednesday. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A16_Tommie_Rockroom&img=IMG_1519.jpg'>tommie</a> called me to alert me of his presence and invite me to scissor sisters. that ruled. we hung out then. and then we went to crobar and I broke myself. <br /><br />i hadn&#8217;t been feeling good. so I stayed in bed friday. then went to my final interview around 5ish on friday. I receieved and accepted my offer and happily went to the paper magazine party at marshall fields. we had a lot to drink and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28554%29.jpg'>played fashion</a> or whatever you <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28556%29.jpg'>play at events</a> like that and decided that since the night was early - we needed some entertainment that was more resturant like. so of course we went to <a href='http://www.tradervics.com/'>trader vics</a>. it was insane. <br /><br />i want to be able to say. &#8220;it was retarded&#8221; - blackeyed peas style. but I don&#8217;t feel that is appropriate. but as anyone who knows me realizes - I am unable to come up with new words on the fly. so I have to think about it. and right now I am thinking about a new word to replace retarded. currently it is insane. but that isn&#8217;t really working in the right way. <br /><br />so anyway. trader vics was <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28560%29.jpg'>retarded</a>. and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28568%29.jpg'>totally a mess</a>. we drank $200 worth of rum drinks and decided to go to the southside to represent up on some art kids. it didn&#8217;t work so we left and went to sound bar to see perry farrell dj. hah. apparently he is a bad dj. I have no idea. I didn&#8217;t really hear him. <br /><br />i met some girl named tracy. hah. we hung out a bit. weird.<br /><br />i found a disposable camera at sound bar and will be posting pictures from it soon. I am excited to see how they turned out. the night was such a mess that it should be at least a bit entertaining. after soundbar I went to spy bar with tracy.. and then they left and I went back to sound bar. then to jays(?) and then to jordans house. then to home. then to sleep. <br /><br />i woke up saturday dieing of the poisoning I had ingested the nigth before. I need to not do that. stupid free drinks. <br /><br />so saturday I met my friend <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty&img=IMG_1556.jpg'>danielle</a> and went to the <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty&img=IMG_1561.jpg'>kill hannah</a> show. it ruled of course. <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty'>a lot of crazines</a>. then I went home. hah. <br />&lt;bR&gt;sunday I went and saw <a href='http://www.gofishpictures.com/GITS2/'>ghost in the shell 2</a> with elaine. that is a dope movie. I quite enjoyed it. so good. so fitting with what I am interested in right now. <br /><br /> speaking of the darkness that has consumed me for the past couple weeks. I have ran out of things to read. so I made a run to amazon.com and purchased some stuff. I picked up: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt; Restraint of Beasts: The by Mills, Magnus<br /> Underground and Vintage Murakami by MURAKAMI, HARUKI&lt;bR&gt; In a Glass Darkly By: Sheridan Le Fanu&lt;bR&gt; The Woman in the Dunes by ABE, KOBO &lt;bR&gt; Amrita, Asleep, and Kitchen by Yoshimoto, Banana <br /> Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words by Rubin, Jay <br /> A Personal Matter by Kenzaburo O?<br /> &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; I am excited. I apparently forgot to by earthquake - by murakami - which is sad. but whatever. I will get it later. I love him. I am currently struggling through <a href='http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/japannew/yumiri1.htm'>gold rush</a> by Yu Miri. I don&#8217;t really like it. and it totally makes me upset. so I don&#8217;t think I can read it any longer. I stopped carrying it. it just seems to be filled with horrible gratuitous violence. so annoying. not even a redeeming story. I need more darkness. <br /><br />i started/made/whatever another site. relaly it is just following through with the plan I made a billion years ago. check out <a href='http://www.fukung.net'>fukung.net</a>. it is my new hong kong/horror/foriegn/action/cultish movie review site. and since I started playign with that I also decided to catalog my movies for reals. I got out my fancy <a href='http://cuecatastrophe.com/'>cuecat</a> barcode scanner - got some <a href='http://collectorz.com/movie/'>software</a> that would do all the dirty work for me. and went to town. it took a couple hours. but the results are pretty good. check out my collection <a href='http://dopeman.org/movies/'>here</a>. all 230 movies or whatever. it is amazing to look at them in that perspective. totally crazy. but whatever. <br /><br />i am tired. weird. I have tried not to go out. and I have been pretty successful. last night I avoided it - but missed a friends bday. sad. I shoudl have gone - but was so tired. and am trying to save money. speaking of saving money I got a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F220920041236&img=Nokia6600%28582%29.jpg'>new wallet</a>. hahaha. <br /><br />i found out today that a lot of people from work read my blog. awesome. hi peoples.</p>

I write about everything. and anything that comes to mind. I don&#8217;t pay attention to what is &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for a blog. I don&#8217;t allow comments. I do this for myself. similar to my pictures. haha. they are all of myself. cuz myself rules.<br /> <br /> btw. in case you were wondering. this post is dumb<br /> <br /> but I digress. really I was annoyed that someone woudl read my blog and then think that I didn&#8217;t expect them to read my blog. wtf. I post almost everything that happens to me and I post &#8221;<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A01%3A31_andriods_on_ice&amp;img=thong%20party%20050.jpg'>wild</a> and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A01%3A31_chicago_thong'>crazy</a>&#8221; party pictures. haha. that is because I am awesome. omg. I am also apparently retarded.<br /> <br /> it is all thought out. it is mine. I hope you like it.</p>

                <p>again. BAM sucka. I feel I should post something awesome to make up for my lame complaining last post. I guess I will give it a shot. <a href='http://www.suzuki.com.au/TWIN.asp'>this car</a> is pretty dope. it woudl be fun. a super mini hybrid. I could carry it up the stairs and such. <a href='http://upcoming.org/'>this site</a> coudl someday be cool. but it might turn into a <a href='http://dodgeball.com'>dodgeball</a> type of thing - where it seems cool but in actuality is too hard to actually participate in. I don&#8217;t know what this is <a href='http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/network/2002/03/08/cory_google.html'>about</a>. really. I have no idea. I suppose I could find <a href='http://heatherw.com/mk/endorse/teenread.htm'>out easy enough</a>. I really can&#8217;t wait for my books to arrive. it will be awesome. &#60;3.<br /> <br /> i don&#8217;t want to leave my house.</p>

                <p>My friend <a href='http://in5anity.org'>Jon</a> got an article written about him in our hometown newspaper. <a href='http://www.greeleytrib.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Site=GR&amp;Date=20030116&amp;Category=OUTDOORS&amp;ArtNo=301150011&amp;Ref=AR&amp;SectionCat=FEATURES'>Check it out</a>. He walked a long way.<br /> <br /> <a href='http://www.businessweek.com/technology/cnet/stories/980889.htm'>Wierd</a> - there is apparently a small amount of opposition to the government having a &#8220;super database&#8221; of information against us citizens. <a href='http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030116-72466627.htm'>And in a shocking move</a> the US decides that N.

I mean obviously everyone from egypt is a terrorist.. and everyone from Bangladesh is a terrorist and everyone from Jordan,Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Syria are terrorists. could you imagine the problems that would occur if france required all U.S. citizens to register. heh. bush would get all upset and maybe say some dumb words. or somthing.

                <p>Last night a friend of mine gave me a couple tickets to the interpol show at the metro. it was a good time. I hadn&#8217;t really heard them and they did put on a good show. it was nice to see and I was able to see soem friends and all that.. wee.. I should get my ipod today. I am excited. I am redoing my MP3 attitude.. I am gunna be setting up a centralized MP3 system for our apartment. I am kinda excited about the prospects.. heh. whatever.<br /> <br /> on friday we all hung out and watched movies.. ate pizza and just chilled. it was funny - because I forget how much of a nerd I am - and my friend brock brought a friend over and I don&#8217;t think she was into the &#8220;weird&#8221; movies that matiss and I were representin&#8217; - I laughed. I wonder what happens when people start hanging out with us. do they think we are insane. cuz are collection of entertainment is very &#8220;interesting..&#8221; in light of that.. my illuminati game should be arriving soon ;)<br /> <br /> i am reading a book by Neil Gaimen called America Gods. I don&#8217;t like it as much as I liked neverwhere, which is making me sad. hopefully good omens will be better. I enjoy my new style of reading: cluster reading. it is where I read a bunch of books by the same author all in a row. it is quite interesting.<br /> <br /> Did you know that <a href='http://www.suntimes.com/output/novak/cst-edt-novak13.html'>republican senators think that the white house is arrogant</a>? or that <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43909-2003Jan11'>bush has planned to attack IRAQ since sept. 17 <b>2001</b></a>? probably not. but I bet you had noticed that the RIAA was <a href='http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/28817.html'>hacked</a> again. ohh the irony. Here is a nifty <a href='http://www.beautyreborn.com/pages/beforeandafter.htm'>link</a> - which garned the following quote from my friend john: &#8221;<i>I've never seen that many tits presented in such a...unerotic way.</i>&#8221; Oh and I almost forgot the most important link. <a href='http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/'>here</a> is an annotated bible targeted towards skeptics. wheee..</p>

                <p>i need to go get some food. I haven&#8217;t really gotten food at the grocery in at least three mmonths. I think that this is rediculous. I don&#8217;t know if that is how you spell rediculous.. however I am not in the mood to look it up right now. I suppose I could just &#8220;program&#8221; my weblog to spell check itself.. but whatever.. I am not THAT bored currently. Tonight I had a big meeting with a &#8220;client&#8221; of mine. it went really well. I like it when business goes well. I then went to a rock show -cursive. I like cursive, but I am tired of the woe is me I am a sad indie rocker who has a girlfriend who hates me.. lalalal.. I wish it was more dynamic like.. &#8220;woe is me the government is oppressive.&#8221;<br />hehe. anyway.. I am sad.. cuz I was supposed to hang out with miriam.. but it didn&#8217;t work out.. :( whatever.. soon enough&#8230;</p>

                <p>today I am tired. I have been working all day an I just don&#8217;t feel well about it. like I should have slept or something. it is weird. I mean I did get up a bit late.. but I feel so &#8220;walking dead-ish&#8221; - ugh. whatever. I will wake up right <em>now</em><br /><br />last night I got an email from riply&#8217;s believe it or not about our friend <a href='http://nata2.info/humor/movies/rusty.mpeg'>rusty</a>. they simply can&#8217;t believe it and wondered the origin of the video. heh. too bad I don&#8217;t have/know the origin. I want more rusty. it is important. This is subtly related to one of my hobbies. I truely enjoy when my websites are linked to or by other sites/posts around the internet. it cracks me up. check out the <a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?q=nata2.info&ie=ISO-8859-1&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search'>usenet</a> for <a href='http://nata2.info'>nata2.info</a> - I have a lot of exposure in the alt.hackers.malicious. I don&#8217;t think this is probably good ;). but whatever. it rules. at least I provided a service or a smile to at least one person. ;) heh. what a fun game. <br /><br />it has been a weird couple of days.. a couple or my friends had rough intros to the new year. one kept hurting herself and the other was <a href='http://thom.watership.org/tools/archives/00000031.html'>stabbed</a> - I hope this doesn&#8217;t dictate a bad injury prone shadow over the rest of the year. oh yea.. it has been one year exactly since my mail server was destroyed by a <a href='http://www.nata2.org/?mode=archive#167'>poorly executed rootkit</a>. heh. <em>knocks on wood</em> hopefully all the haxors that are attacking my boxen will be able to install their rootkits with more success and not bring down all of my boxes. :( ;). <br /><br /></p>

                <p>So I have this car and I hate driving it. I never hated it before I moved to chicago. it is just so annoying.. parking and all that crap along with trying to navigate the crazy system that is chicago traffic&#8230; whatever.. and now I have to license, insure and all that crap.. whatever whatever whatever.. heh.<br /><br />one nice thing about driving that you don&#8217;t have as much with the train - is you can stop and get things on the way.. like tonight. I decided that I was going to stay in and try and invite some friends over.. and we could watch some movies or play games.. so I stopped by( on the way) tower records and picked up some dvds.. I got minority report, macross plus, city of lost souls(weird), amadeus(hehe) and three cirque du soliel dvds. I am excited. so.. anyway.. I called some friends.. and hooked up with some kids.. and we all played some games (crononauts and boogle) and generally hung out. it was nice.. I enjoy stuff like that.. hanging out and such..</p>

                <p>I had a good weekend. I hung out all sorts of good friends and heard the downlow on everyones holiday. What a nice thing holidays are. I need another one so I don&#8217;t get so sleepy. ;) On saturday miriam and myself went to a rather humorous play called &#8221;<a href='http://elviswebsite.com/'>cooking with elvis</a>.&#8221; It was quite interesting and had some very funny moments - it was also slightly depressing.. about family dysfunction and the like..</p>
<br />
<p>i am excited for new years however - I really don&#8217;t know what I am going to do.. but I imagine it will be fun. it better be. I hope to get a bunch of sleep tonight so that I can really go out on the 31st. it is strange that it is going to be 2003 in 2 days. weird. <br />x) - sleep now</p>

I am sitting here, back at work, typing this entry in lynx - cuz my windows and primary desktop broke good. ;) I have replaced the hard drive and I am now installing win2k .. whee what fun. I cannot remember when I have had such fun. So .. christmas was entertaining. I enjoyed it. I miss hanging with my parents and stuff already. I really like them. however now I get to see Miriam and hang out with my friends so that is super cool. I do need to finish my christmas cards something fierce&#8230; soon.. soon..</p>

                <p>So last night my brother graduated college. It was probably the most entertaining graduation ceremony I have seen in a long long time. One of the speakers kept swearing and cussing.. hehe. and everyone kept gasping at what he was saying. but he kept it up - it was so funny. I laughed a bunch. Only 20 or so people graduated. so it was a very small group. After the ceremony we went to dinner at this nice sea food resturant. My first friend pam came and sat with us.. I say my first friend - cuz she was one of my first friends I met in chicago.. so it was nice to see her. THe funniest thing she told me was that she went on a couple of dates with C.C. deville. haha.. rule.<br /> <br /> So then today.. we hung out and played at this weird tourist place. my brother and I played a couple mean games of air hockey and then we went on this boat accross the bay. It was nice. I like the ocean a lot. I would like to eventually live somewhere near the ocean. Oh yea.. last night at dinner I met my brothers friend <a href='http://www.kronusfilms.com'>scott</a> - he is pretty cool ;)<br /> <br /> It is interesting cuz I miss chicago a little. I miss work a little and I miss my friends a little. Usually I don&#8217;t do these things. but work is going well and right now the who &#8220;friend&#8221; situation is nice. I really miss them.. heh. check the following links out: <a href='http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134599925_webmurray20.html'>here</a> and <a href='http://www.mirror.co.uk/voiceofthemirror/'>here</a></p>

                <p>i find myself in an airport terminal.. using my trusty cell phone as internet access. I was noticing today that I have magically switched my palm pilot for my laptop. weird. I mean the laptop isn&#8217;t much bigger.. but still - I can&#8217;t fit it in my pocket and I can&#8217;t use it to navigate my palm..<br /><br />I am going to LA in an hour to see my brother graduate from <a href='http://www.coo.edu'>commercial diving school</a>. It will be exciting. I brought my clubs.. so I can&#8217;t wait to juggle.. hoepfully the weather is good. I love good weather. however.. I am not really in the mood for good weather (besides juggling :P). it is just that I don&#8217;t really have warm weather clothes.. especially in the dead of winter.. stupid heat.<br /><br />I hope to get a lot of work done.. this break.. I need to plan my newest and greatest project. a little bit of 3gscreensaver for everyone! hehe. <br /><br />i am going to miss hanging out with miriam.. and such.. but I will see her soon.. heh.. <br /><br />i guess I am famous.. <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=war'>check it</a>&#8230;</p>

                <p>My computer at work is dieing a slow and painful death. The dell bios diagnostic screen pops up on boot and tells me that my hard drive is going to fail very soon. Ugh.. I am sad. I don&#8217;t want to lose everything. I mean I have it all backed up.. for the most part <b>;)</b> - the thing I am most sad about is my music.. I have ripped so many of my cds so I don&#8217;t have to keep them here.. and now it appears as I will have to re-rip them <b>:(</b>&#8230; so sad.. <br /><br />This weekend was quite nice.. I enjoyed it ;). After stomp.. kinnera got mad cuz I ditched her.. I didn&#8217;t really but she thinks I did.. so I hung out by myself.. all saturday.. played with my surround sound system.. pointed the speakers at the right places.. and replaced the little bad speakers with some larger more full range speakers.. it should sound a bit better.. heh.<br /> After playing surround sound and completely disrupting my house.. I hung out a bit and watched some TV.. Miriam came over and we played a bunch of UNO. how I love UNO. Miriam and I then went to go see common at the HOB. whee. common was quite good. he has such nice eyes&#8230;. heh.. <br />anyway.. after common we went to a very strange party.. which was also fun. a kid there had a duncan yoyo - I haven&#8217;t played with one of those in years and years.. it was fun trying all my yoyo tricks on such a poor yoyo. I was able to pull off quite a few.. surprise.. <br />Then we all went home.. and hung out.. Yesterday - we went to lula and watched crouching tiger hidden dragon.. I haven&#8217;t seen it in awhile.. I love the movie.. and the music is soo good. <br /><br />So.. it was a veyr nice weekend. I have quite enjoyed hanging out with Miriam.. it is refreshing and fun. whee.. <br /><br />Well I think that N. Korea will join Iraq.. heh. whee. is right.. N. Korea == Nuclear Weapons. Iraq == Fun enemy. Both == Violent War. Violent War == Happy Bush. Happy Bush == Happy World. Happy World == <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/Incoming/gunship_video.mpg'>Heaven</a></p>

                <p>Today I didn&#8217;t goto work. I was sick and didn&#8217;t feel like I could make it through a whole day of work. I haven&#8217;t been eating all that well.. and it was reflected by my bodies giving up and telling me to fuck off .. heh .. yea that is pretty much how it went ;) so I slept until 5:30&#8230; which was weird - cuzi planned on coming in to work after 1:00 - but whatever.. one of the weirder things in my life is having fun and wanting to goto work. cuz - 1.6 years ago when I started I was not as into work as I am now. I really didn&#8217;t like it and it was mostly a pain.. but now I miss a day and am sad.. hehe. whatever. I am a nerd..<br /><br />So.. in other news&#8230; I went on a really nice date on monday night.. and hung out with the girl on tuesday as well. it is really nice.. and I like it a lot..</p>

                <p>Last night we watched the first full length movie on my <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006YZ3Z/nata2productions'>new TV</a>. It was nice.. especially with my <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000658AY/nata2productions'>new receiver</a>. heh. I really don&#8217;t know what to do about my old receiver.. but whatever - we watched the new <i>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the ring</i> with all the extra footage and such. whee.. I like that movie.. I have watched it far too many times.. It was a nice gathering though.. some new friends and some old friends.. I like that the best.. <br /><br />This weekend was filled with juggling.. juggling.. juggling.. so much juggling.. it all started on thursday.. when we juggled for the Crunch Corp. holiday party. It was fun.. but kinda weird.. the problem was the venue.. it is always very hard to juggle in a dark club especially when you don&#8217;t quite know what the people want.. heh.. then on saturday we juggled at the <a href='http://www.movieside.neweyefilms.com/'>Movieside Film Festival</a>.. which was quite entertaining. we juggled there on saturday and sunday. heh. a lot of cool people were invloved and the organizer Rusty Nails was really great. <br /><br />Ugh.. I just remembered that my flights for christmas were on united.. wtf am I doing flying united.. I thought I only flew american.. apparently not.. ugh. I hope this doesn&#8217;t cause problems.. I want to see my bro graduate and I don&#8217;t want to have to pay a billion dollars.. <br /><br /> <a href='http://www.modsquare.com/more.php?id=56_0_8_0_M'>i am famous</a>&#8230; wheee&#8230;</p>

                <p>I like buildings. When I was a child, my father subscribed to Architectural Digest. I used to read and look at the pictures of incredible architectural feats. I always imagined living in a place that had buildings that were nice. I finally found a building that is very nice. It is the <a href='http://www.dims.net/bm/building2.jpg'>R.R. donnelley building</a>. Is a quite modern and has a neat lighting scheme. Inside it has incredible art and uses a lot of pretty black and white marble(i think).</p>

                <p>Today is kinda tough. I didn&#8217;t sleep well last night.. maybe it had to do with me staying up until all hours of the morning. It is still hard, I don&#8217;t know what I expect? I mean it has barely been two days since it happened. I guess I expect a drastic change.. like I will suddenly get over her. however.. I know that is impossible. I look at all the pictures I have, all the letters and I am scared to read them.. to gaze at them.. I know it will hurt.. I really don&#8217;t understand..<br /><br /> On a different not, I feel kinda lame talking to this webpage. especially when everyone has the oppurtunity to look at it. whatever&#8230; I dare you to look at it..</p>

                <p>today was hard. I was able to hold up. Work was ok. I am trying to decide a hobby. maybe direct TV hacking.. maybe console stuff.. maybe getting a no region dvd. . I am thinking about drowning my sorrows in technology(something I do really good) and buying a laptop. hmm.. but I need one with UXGA(ahhh 1600x1200), however that shit is expensive.. I don&#8217;t want to pay $2500 for a freaking computer(ha ha) <br /><br /> anyway. I am doing a lot better. it is still really hard. I look around my room and notice all the pictures all the letters, all the stuff that relates to her. I know it is silly. I mean she is just not my girlfriend.. but all that stuff has some resemblence(at least for now) of what was once.. and what isn&#8217;t now.. however - I don&#8217;t think that it will be like that for long. she is still my best friend and will always be (i hope). I htink tha time will help.. and like a good friend said - it only matters on what you do with that time&#8230; <br /> <br /> I hope to make a palm game.. hehe..</p>

                <p>today, my girlfriend and I have decided to break up. It wasn&#8217;t the best of situations for each other&#8230;. So after fourteen wonderful months together we are separating amicably. it was the only choice that allowed for us to maintain health and happiness. at least in our current situation. <br /><br /> However.. now I am a little lost.. I don&#8217;t know what to do or to say.. I type these words and fear a numbness that could quickly approach. How come love doesn&#8217;t conquer all.. <br /><br /> I type these words and I wish that things were quickly different. but whenever I wish that I know that to wish that is a bad thing. It is hard now. however I know it will be easier soon. I will sleep, get up, go to work, go home, eat, and repeat. I will go out with friends. I will hang out and meet new people. I will get back into a pattern. I just want something I cannot have right now. I need to realize also that I still have my friendship with her. that she is still my best friend. I haven&#8217;t lost anything really. I mean.. really</p>

                <p>Ha..<br /> Well after numerous people have asked.. I did have a rough time lately. however I am ok now. I was just sad for a breif period and everyone left. I didn&#8217;t have anyone to reflect off of, or to talk to, so I used the wonderful internet and the lovely &#8220;blog&#8221; to be my emotional reflection pool. thanks for the support.</p>

                <p>Yesterday was kinnera&#8217;s birthday. Lets all say happy Birthday to her. <br /> Tonight I went to a shoddy rock show and saw a guy who used to play with the smashing pumpkins. It was wierd because members of the &#8220;pumpkins&#8221; were at the show. Often when I see famous people it takes me a little while t figure out that they are real. I guess that is what I get for living in a fantasy world. Well gnight all. Happy Birthday to Kinnera..</p>

                <p>Hip Hop. Oh yes.. <br /> Well, another christmas has gone and went.. and to think i just started acknowledging the year 200 last month.. heh.. its almost 2k1. I think it is funny how time flys. i mean i just started school almost 4 years ago.. when i was like 19.. now as i approach my 23rd birthday, i realize that their isn&#8217;t really a difference between being 23 and being 45. it is afterall, just time. <br /> I went to the dentist today, and during the parts that were uncomfortable i meditated. I have never meditated before, but i just forced myself to be calm. i relaxed.. even though i wasn&#8217;t in a physical state of relaxation. i made my mind separte from the body that was holding me down.. i got frustrated however, because i wanted to discuss some matters with the dentist, but i was unable to talk.. so i just hung out in my head.. haha.. i am turning into something. i think the ability to push your feelings inward, and think about them is interesting. it is also soo dangerous.. luckly.. the feelings i am talking about are of a physical nature.. not a emotional nature.. i need to get those feelings out..<br /> word</p>

I am currently spending some time building interesting things and hacking for <a href="http://www.nepholologist.com/">rackspace</a>. In a previous life, I was the CTO of the awesome <a href="http://www.threadless.com">Threadless</a>. 
This is obviously my blog. I write about everything from being a professional yoyoer to hacking the newest Internet appliance. Be sure and check out my homepage at <a href="http://www.harperreed.org">harperreed.org</a>. If you are so interested, my resume is located <a href="http://www.harperreed.org/resume">here</a>. I love getting emails and what not so feel free to contact me through <a href="http://www.harperreed.org/contact">here</a>. </p>
<p>Be sure and take a gander at&nbsp;my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/">photos</a>.</p>
